Join us for a conversation with author Sean Wilsey, who captured the curiosity of life as a San Francisco society child in his 2005 memoir Oh the Glory of it All. Wilsey, an avid skateboarder and boarding school wayfarer, chronicled a youth spent in and out of San Francisco’s upper echelons with what the New York Times described as a “vivid mix of brio, self-awareness and sophistication.”  
  
In Wilsey’s new collection of essays, More Curious, the author paints a compelling picture of an America he found to be “much kinder and less homogenous” than he feared. More Curious spans fifteen years of Wilsey’s work and includes musings on life in rural Texas, what soccer and religion have in common, and the state of skateboarding — and American culture — today. Other essays include those previously published in GQ, McSweeney’s, The New York Times Magazine, National Geographic, Fast Company, and Vanity Fair.  
  
Join Wilsey as he discusses More Curious, the power of place, and memoir as catharsis. Wilsey will be joined in conversation by his mother, non-fiction author and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Pat Montandon. 
  
Mr. Wilsey is able here to convey his feelings earnestly...with the same vividness and immediacy he brings to his descriptions of people, places and things. 
The New York Times 
  
Whether Sean Wilsey’s subject is rats, NASA, or a surreal road trip across America, the writing is animated and diverse, dappled with literary oddities and enlivened, always, by his eye for the absurd.

Follow us on Twitter @sba_pacific (https://twitter.com/SBA_pacific) ; like us on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/SBAgov) and check out the official SBA YouTube Channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/sba).The Sierra Nevada, with its 14,000-foot granite mountains, crystalline lakes, conifer forests, and hidden valleys, has long been the domain of dreams, attracting the heroic and the delusional, the best of humanity and the worst. Stories abound, and characters emerge so outlandish and outrageous that they have to be real. Could the human imagination have invented someone like Eliza Gilbert? Born in Limerick, Ireland, in 1818, she transformed herself into Lola Montez, born in Seville, Spain, in 1823, and brought to the Gold Country the provocative “Spider Dance”—impersonating a young woman repelling a legion of angry spiders under her petticoats. Or Otto Esche, who in 1860 imported fifteen two-humped Bactrian camels from Asia to transport goods to the mines. Or the artist Albert Bierstadt, whose paintings Mark Twain characterized as having “more the atmosphere of Kingdom-Come than of California.” Or multimillionaire George Whittell Jr., who was frequently spotted driving around Lake Tahoe in a luxurious convertible with his pet lion in the front seat. These, and scores more, spill out of the pages of this well-illustrated and lively tribute to the Sierra by a native son.

Queer Yo Mind bridges the gaps between academia and activism by fostering a space of exchange. The notion of "queer" employed by the conference includes, yet extends past, gender expression and sexual orientation in an effort to empower queer communities.Adam Gazzaley, M.D.; Ph.D; Founding Director, Neuroscience Imaging Center, Associate Professor in Neurology, Physiology and Psychiatry, UC San Francisco 
A fundamental challenge of modern society is the development of effective approaches to enhance brain function in both healthy and impaired individuals, and some people have serious concerns about the ability of either our current education or health-care system to meet this challenge. Gazzaley will share a vision of the future in which video games integrated with technological innovations in software and hardware are used as an engine to harness brain plasticity and enhance our cognitive abilities, thus reducing our reliance on non-specific drugs to treat neurological and psychiatric conditions and allowing us to better target and personalize our educational efforts.

Spend four days in the studio with me, learning almost all there is to know about acrylic paint.  This is not a workshop about technique, per se, but more about the paint itself.  What we will cover: 

All about gels, mediums and paints. 
Color - mixing clean color, opacity/transparency, mineral/modern.
Drying time.
Extending the paint.
Making glazes. 
Working with water.
And more!

You will leave with about 10-12 boards made up of samples of gels, mediums, pastes, and paint.  You will gain a thorough understanding of how to accomplish what you want with acrylic.  
And...all materials are supplied!  Paint, gels, mediums, boards. You bring yourself and some brushes. I'll do the rest.

Learn more about the inaugural Range of Light Film Festival from its' founder, Steven Bumgardner, and hear from filmmakers who made stunning short films for the Film Festival. 
About the Range of Light Film Festival - 
2014 Theme: The theme for the inaugural Range of Light Film Festival is 150 Years of Yosemite. In June 2014 we celebrated the establishment of Yosemite as a protected area, the genesis of the national park idea and our park as the birthplace of international land conservation. On June 30, 1864, in the midst of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln signed an unprecedented bill, the Yosemite Grant, which set aside the Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley as the nation’s first protected areas. The seed of an idea was planted – that our nation’s most magnificent and sacred natural spaces should be preserved for everyone and all time. Indeed, the national park movement grew nationally and internationally from President Lincoln’s bold action, and today helps define who we are as Americans. 
The history and many tales about Yosemite are often overshadowed by the park’s world famous and iconic features such as Half Dome, El Capitan and Yosemite Falls. The film festival displayed how filmmakers, artists and storytellers have been inspired and used the park as a backdrop for their creative and varied interpretations. Audience members left the festival with a greater appreciation for Yosemite, having viewed it in new and surprising ways, and a renewed sense for the importance of conservation, maintaining public lands, and preserving natural resources for future generations.

No wonder CHICAGO has been honored with 6 Tony Awards®, 2 Olivier Awards®, a Grammy® and thousands of standing ovations. It's also no surprise that CHICAGO has wowed audiences all around the world, from Mexico City to Moscow, from Sao Paulo to South Africa.  Whether you're looking for your first Broadway musical, whether you've seen the Academy Award®-winning film and want to experience the show live on stage or whether you've seen it before and want to recapture the magic, CHICAGO always delivers.There's no questioning that epic parties take place throughout the year. Some fall on holidays, while some just take place on random weekends with no premeditated planning. But there's one night where everyone plans, and "just winging it" won't cut it because it's considered the biggest and most important night of the year - New Year's Eve. On this night, thousands flock to San Francisco to enjoy all of the entertainment that's taking place on land. But if you're a local, chances are you need something a little different. Something alternative to what you're normally used to on this night. That's where NewYearsCruise.com comes in. Featuring some of the top New Year's Eve cruises that the nation has to offer, when you narrow it down to San Francisco, all eyes are on the Harbor Princess for the New Year's Eve Fireworks Cruise.  
Featuring two and a half hours of premium open bar, music served up by a live DJ, and a special champagne toast at midnight, this is an event that offers up the kind of fun that you won't find on land. While you may be used to spending NYE with your family, this cruise is adults-only, so you can be sure that there will be an unadulterated atmosphere giving you a chance to truly enjoy yourself. What's the best part? You'll get a chance to take in the famous landmarks located around San Francisco, including Treasure Island, Alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the phenomenal city skyline. All the while, prepare to get the perfect vantage point as the biggest and best fireworks display on the west coast will take place right before your eyes as you cruise by. There's a lot of excitement packed into this event, just be sure you plan accordingly and sort out your tickets while you still have a chance.   Boarding:10:00pm Departing:10:15pm Returning:12:45amVisit http://www.usgbc-ncc.org/learn/leed-v4-educational-series for complete event information!

TRIP STATUS: Trips may be cancelled by the Oceanic Society for any of these reasons: 

Hazardous Sea Conditions – on the morning of the trip the Captain will assess sea conditions, specifically offshore wind and waves. If he determines it is unsafe to go out, the trip will be cancelled. Weather offshore can be dramatically different from weather on land. Trip status is not available earlier than the morning of the trip as weather conditions can change overnight. Please call the Weather Status number below on the morning of your trip for an updated trip status. If it is raining, but sea conditions are safe, the trip will still depart. For those of you travelling long distances, we recommend planning an alternate activity in the area in the event the trip has to be cancelled. 
Under-subscription – advance notice will be given along with an opportunity to reschedule to another day or receive a refund.
Other acts of God.

 WEATHER STATUS (415) 256-9524 
Call after 6:00 a.m. for 8:00 a.m. departure 
NO-SHOWS & LATECOMERS: If you are late & the boat departs without you, or you decide not to go out, the entire fee is forfeited and no refunds will be given. 
SEASICKNESS: Seasickness is a real possibility as this is a rigorous open ocean trip. We strongly urge that you consult a pharmacist or physician about sea-sickness precautions and adhere strictly to manufacturer’s directions (especially if medication must be taken hours prior to boarding). Be well rested the morning of your trip, avoiding alcoholic beverages the previous night. On the day of your trip, eat a high-protein, non-fatty breakfast. Bring crackers and soda if you anticipate queasiness. Remember, prevention is the only cure! The boat does not turn around due to seasickness. 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RISK: This is a rigorous open-ocean trip. There are inherent risks in being on a vessel on the ocean. Our Naturalist or Captain will speak to you about ways you can ensure your safety, but the boat will be moving with the waves and swells, so please hold on as you move about the boat. You will be asked to sign an acknowledgement of the potential risks before the trip departs. We appreciate your cooperation and ask that you follow the instructions of the crew and naturalist at all times. 
NATURALIST: An Oceanic Society Naturalist will meet you near the stone building at the entrance to the pier. Please do not disturb the Harbormaster as he doesn’t have information about our trips. 
EQUIPMENT: Binoculars, sunglasses and sunscreen are strongly recommended. You may also wish to bring a camera with a telephoto lens and a lens cover to protect your camera from spray. Insect repellent is optional. We may encounter non-biting kelp flies at the islands. 
PHOTOS: Oceanic Society is always looking for wildlife photos from our trips to share with our followers. If you take photos and wouldn’t mind sharing them (with credit, of course) please send them to our office at redstone@oceanicsociety.org             
CLOTHING: Warm layered clothing with a waterproof layer is essential. We suggest a jacket, sweater, hat, gloves, warm socks, waterproof, non-skid boots or shoes and a rain jacket for sea spray, rain or wet fog. Our trips go rain or shine, so be prepared. There is limited seating and not everyone can be in the cabin at the same time.  
FOOD and DRINK: Our vessels do NOT have food available. Bring your own snacks and beverages in a day pack. The vessel cannot accommodate coolers or picnic baskets. In an effort to reduce plastic pollution in our oceans, OS suggests that you refrain from bringing single-use plastic water bottles.  
If you would like more information about plastics pollution in our oceans, please visit the following websites: 
http://plasticpollutioncoalition.org/learn/basic-concepts/ 
http://greenlivingideas.com/2011/08/01/plastic-world-infographic/ 
REFUNDS: Reservations are non-refundable unless Oceanic Society cancels the trip for some reason. If you, or a member of your group cannot participate due to illness or other emergency, you may give or sell your tickets to another party. The bonus Farallon Island DVD is not included with any trip refunds. In no event shall our liability exceed the obligation to refund the amount you paid to us. 
RESCHEDULING: If you need to reschedule your trip for some reason, please call or email the office at 415-256-9941 or redstone@oceanicsociety.org. You may only reschedule within the same season. 
RETURNED CHECKS: There is a $10 service charge on all returned checks. 
RESTRICTIONS - AGE LIMIT & PREGNANCY: Unpredictable sea conditions, seasickness and trip duration necessitate these restrictions: 

Children under the age of 10 are not permitted on the boat. No exceptions.
OS strongly recommends that children wear a life jacket on the boat at all times.
Children under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult.
If pregnant, the unpredictable movements of the boat could result in a loss of balance. Therefore, we strongly suggest scheduling your trip for another time. 

  
VESSELS: OS primarily uses the Salty Lady for trips, however, in certain circumstances another vessel may be substituted. All vessels carry life vests, are Coast Guard certified, and insured, with limited indoor and outdoor seating. 
TURN-AROUNDS: In the unlikely event a trip turns around after departing the dock, Oceanic Society has this policy: 

Return to the dock within the first 4 hours: a $60 per person fuel charge will be assessed
Return to the dock after 4 hours: the trip will be considered complete. No refunds or rescheduling will occur.

TRIP STATUS: Trips may be cancelled by the Oceanic Society for any of these reasons: 

Hazardous Sea Conditions – on the morning of the trip the Captain will assess sea conditions, specifically offshore wind and waves. If he determines it is unsafe to go out, the trip will be cancelled. Weather offshore can be dramatically different from weather on land. Trip status is not available earlier than the morning of the trip as weather conditions can change overnight. Please call the Weather Status number below on the morning of your trip for an updated trip status. If it is raining, but sea conditions are safe, the trip will still depart. For those of you travelling long distances, we recommend planning an alternate activity in the area in the event the trip has to be cancelled. 
Under-subscription – advance notice will be given along with an opportunity to reschedule to another day or receive a refund.
Other acts of God.

 WEATHER STATUS (415) 256-9524 
Call after 6:00 a.m. for 8:00 a.m. departure 
NO-SHOWS & LATECOMERS: If you are late & the boat departs without you, or you decide not to go out, the entire fee is forfeited and no refunds will be given. 
SEASICKNESS: Seasickness is a real possibility as this is a rigorous open ocean trip. We strongly urge that you consult a pharmacist or physician about sea-sickness precautions and adhere strictly to manufacturer’s directions (especially if medication must be taken hours prior to boarding). Be well rested the morning of your trip, avoiding alcoholic beverages the previous night. On the day of your trip, eat a high-protein, non-fatty breakfast. Bring crackers and soda if you anticipate queasiness. Remember, prevention is the only cure! The boat does not turn around due to seasickness. 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RISK: This is a rigorous open-ocean trip. There are inherent risks in being on a vessel on the ocean. Our Naturalist or Captain will speak to you about ways you can ensure your safety, but the boat will be moving with the waves and swells, so please hold on as you move about the boat. You will be asked to sign an acknowledgement of the potential risks before the trip departs. We appreciate your cooperation and ask that you follow the instructions of the crew and naturalist at all times. 
NATURALIST: An Oceanic Society Naturalist will meet you near the stone building at the entrance to the pier. Please do not disturb the Harbormaster as he doesn’t have information about our trips. 
EQUIPMENT: Binoculars, sunglasses and sunscreen are strongly recommended. You may also wish to bring a camera with a telephoto lens and a lens cover to protect your camera from spray. Insect repellent is optional. We may encounter non-biting kelp flies at the islands.

TRIP STATUS: Trips may be cancelled by the Oceanic Society for any of these reasons: 

Hazardous Sea Conditions – on the morning of the trip the Captain will assess sea conditions, specifically offshore wind and waves. If he determines it is unsafe to go out, the trip will be cancelled. Weather offshore can be dramatically different from weather on land. Trip status is not available earlier than the morning of the trip as weather conditions can change overnight. Please call the Weather Status number below on the morning of your trip for an updated trip status. If it is raining, but sea conditions are safe, the trip will still depart. For those of you travelling long distances, we recommend planning an alternate activity in the area in the event the trip has to be cancelled.

Other acts of God.

 WEATHER STATUS (415) 256-9524 
Call after 6:00 a.m. for 8:00 a.m. departure 
NO-SHOWS & LATECOMERS: If you are late & the boat departs without you, or you decide not to go out, the entire fee is forfeited and no refunds will be given. 
SEASICKNESS: Seasickness is a real possibility as this is a rigorous open ocean trip. We strongly urge that you consult a pharmacist or physician about sea-sickness precautions and adhere strictly to manufacturer’s directions (especially if medication must be taken hours prior to boarding). Be well rested the morning of your trip, avoiding alcoholic beverages the previous night. On the day of your trip, eat a high-protein, non-fatty breakfast. Bring crackers and soda if you anticipate queasiness. Remember, prevention is the only cure! The boat does not turn around due to seasickness. 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RISK: This is a rigorous open-ocean trip. There are inherent risks in being on a vessel on the ocean. Our Naturalist or Captain will speak to you about ways you can ensure your safety, but the boat will be moving with the waves and swells, so please hold on as you move about the boat. You will be asked to sign an acknowledgement of the potential risks before the trip departs. We appreciate your cooperation and ask that you follow the instructions of the crew and naturalist at all times. 
NATURALIST: An Oceanic Society Naturalist will meet you near the stone building at the entrance to the pier. Please do not disturb the Harbormaster as he doesn’t have information about our trips.

St. Anthony's Dining Hall is in dire need of volunteers! 
 Are you free to lend a hand in serving about 2,600 lunches to our neighbors faced with food scarcity? 
 Let us know if you can join! 
 
More About the Dining Hall: 
In San Francisco one in five adults lack the resources to provide food for themselves or their families. In the Tenderloin, that number is as high as one in two.  St. Anthony's offsets this basic lack of resources by serving nearly a million hot, nutritions meals each year. 
The meals served feed individuals and families who have slipped through the safety net: veterans, seniors, the working poor, homeless and low-income residents, recent immigrants, recent parolees, and the mentally and addictively ill. 
The Dining Room has served poor and homeless Tenderloin residents since 1950; through six decades of growing demand, a guest has never been turned away for lack of food. More than one-third of guests rely on these meals as their only source of food each day. 
  
What We'll Be Up To: 
We will prepare meal trays, serve meals to guests (our neighbors faced with food scarcity), bus tables, work on the food line and prep kitchen, and ensure that everything stays spic and span. All volunteers will have the opportunity to experience several different positions. In between, we're invited (urged!) to grab lunch to keep our stamina up and more importantly, share food and conversation with the guests at the Dining Room tables. 
  
What to Wear: 
Casual, comfortable clothing and shoes. Lockers are available for the storage of small valuables (cell phone, keys, etc). 
  
What to Bring: 
Volunteer Release of Liability Form:      Each participant is requested to sign a copy of the Volunteer Release of Liability Form. It will be collected upon your arrival at St. Anthony Foundation. The form can be accessed here--Please print and bring it with you:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1uTpTxTuSPbWWd4dUp2amZCLVk/edit?usp=sharing  Thank you!

Subscribe to our mailing listDo you hate Networking as much as most of us do? Are you also bad at it, often wondering why no one returns your calls or follows up with you after a "Networking Event"? Join us each month in San Francisco at The Box SF for "The Art of Active Networking", and let's change everything you believe about Networking!  
TheArtofActiveNetworking.com   
Come see why nearly 10,000 people have attended worldwide!  Tickets are 20$ on-line on our site until 6pm the day of the event and 30$ at the door until 7:30pm...the event ends about 9:30pm! You must purchase a ticket in advance to get the 20$ pricing. 
At this event you will make some amazing connections and you will learn why Networking is not about what you get, but what you give. And you really only need to meet one person to make your entire night worthwhile if you know what you are doing. You will have an opportunity to speak to everyone in the room, and you will absolutely meet people you might otherwise never have an opportunity to meet. Finally you are then invited to join all of our groups and pages and use our FREE walls to post up what you might be looking for.  
San Francisco is our home city and where it all started, so you will be able to connect with amazing people from around the world!   
Everything you need to know about this event is on our site. Join the pages and the groups, spread the word and read the testimonials on our site about what people have said after attending: 
TheArtofActiveNetworking.com 
Mark E. Sackett started this in San Francisco 5 years ago as a way to help others do better in life, love and business.

He works daily in Branding, Marketing, Film, Television and Music and as an events producer and speaker on living an authentic, powerful and creative life.

For more information and/or registration, please visit www.ahinternational.org.Most leaders or aspiring leaders struggle with how to inspire people within an organization, team or community to develop a shared, positive, compassionate, and self-responsible attitude; the Principles of Attitudinal Healing. At the same time, many workers complain that they are unable to bring their inner values into their work environment. People often feel trapped by competition, fear, and a lack of vision. Leaders can play a critical role in igniting an excitement that translates inner values into a shared commitment of positive, creative action. 
Additionally, change is now the norm and leaders need to know how to positively align a group, workforce or organization to change — moving from fear to building resilience and a creative approach to change. Several tools will be presented along with some examples and success stories.

For more information and/or registration, please visit www.ahinternational.org.This workshop offers hands-on experience with the Choose Again conflict resolution process. This process is extraordinarily effective in all relationships and has proven to be literally a relationship saver. Whether you use this methodology in your intimate relationships, in business or with your children, you will experience an immediate and deeply felt release of conflict, pain and dis-ease. Based on the Principles ofAttitudinal Healing, this process teaches the practitioner to: 
• take full ownership and total accountability • undo blame and projection • arrive at a state of complete peace • achieve deep transformation of all relationships 
through profound and lasting core belief correction. Who you think you are is not Who You Are. This process is a sure path to remembering your True Identity and to then bringing that Identity to all your relationships. One way a student of the work summed it up succincdy: Applied Forgiveness InAction.

Yoga Alliance is the registering body for yoga schools and yoga teachers. Yoga Alliance sets the minimum standards that programs are expected to meet through practice and theory within a teacher training course. Once a student completes a training with a Yoga Alliance approved school, they are then eligible to register with Yoga Alliance as a certified yoga teacher.

Maybe food only crosses your mind when you’re truly hungry…or maybe your relationship with food feels more like you’re wandering through a complicated maze. When you add in common digestive challenges like constipation, gas, bloating, indigestion, diarrhea or nausea, figuring out what works for your body can start to feel like a full-time job. 
This small group coaching program is specifically created for women who: 

are tired of spending so much time and energy struggling with their digestion and not seeing results.
are ready to engage with their body and symptoms in a less adversarial manner.
want to find a way of eating that they can stick with over the long-term.

In this month-long program, we’ll work together to design and implement a treatment plan that addresses the root causes of your symptoms. As a result, you’ll experience improved digestive function, clarity around food choices and an understanding of how your body uses symptoms to communicate with you when its conditions for proper nourishment aren’t being met. 
To learn more about the program and what we'll cover each week, please head over to erinmazow.com/vitalroots.Schedule: 6 sessions; once a week for six weeks Class Dates: 7-10pm on Tuesdays September 30, October 7, 14, 21, 29, and Nov. 4 Class size: 12 students maximum Class length: 3 hours (18 hours total) Prerequisite: Foundation 2  
Foundation 3 focuses on developing skills such as performance-oriented scene work, ensemble, character, acting, and other advanced improv skills. A smaller class size means more stage time and detailed, individual feedback from your coach about your work.  Coaches will help students identify ways in which they can more fully embody the basic improv principles, as well as identifying areas for improvement.    Since Foundation 3’s focus is on your individual work, this is a great tune-up class for students of all levels and can be taken multiple times!  
At the final session, the coach will provide specific feedback to the player and provide a recommendation for the next class.   

  BATS Improv Class Refund Policy:  Your class tuition includes a non-refundable deposit equal to 20% of your payment.  If you have registered for a class and decide you want to drop that class AT LEAST 14 DAYS BEFORE THE FIRST CLASS SESSION, you may choose to receive a refund for the amount of the class minus your non-refundable deposit OR you may choose to reapply your payment IN FULL to another BATS class.  Classes dropped 4-13 days before the start of the class are not eligible for the re-application of full payment to another class. You may either reapply your payment (minus the applicable deposit) or receive a partial refund. This option is not available for those enrolled in summer intensives or youth/teen camps.

When they don't do what we ask or expect, we are disappointed. How fair are our demands? How often do we give what we ask others for? 
In this workshop we look at what disturbs our relationships and we touch the essence of it — which is always love. From there (inner) peace can be restored. This doesn't mean that you always get what you want. It means that you can choose to be peaceful inside regardless of what is happening outside. The offered exercises harmonize the relationship on an essential level, if you choose to accept the invitation.

For more information and/or registration, please visit www.ahinternational.org.This workshop challenges the myth that people cannot find a meaningful and lasting relationship, no matter what their current age or situation. It builds on the Principles ofAttitudinal Healing to show how and why spiritually attuned people can find each other and, with right-mindedness, can build relationships that are mutually enhancing and long-lasting. We will discuss the specific steps necessary in contemporary society to find a suitable partner, and challenge contemporary views of romantic love that so often impede people from building a real and loving relationship.

If stress and anxiety are problems in your life, its largely because genetics and a painful past wired your brain for an emotional set-point that hyper activates the stress response system. A change in mindset can alter the way the stress gene expresses and change brain structure to extinguish stress reactions. In the absence of toxic stress hormones, higher order brain networks flourish, increasing your capacity for higher achievement, emotional balance, and creative insight. 
This three-hour seminar provides the basic change in mindset that changes the state of your brain, from an emotional set-point that habituates stress to one that sustains a dynamic state of peace. The result is more joy in your work, more peace at home, more love in your relationships, and more spring in your step. In the three hours we'll spend together, you'll learn a simple daily practice that can begin to change your brain to move your life in this general direction.

Sound familiar? "Whose life is this anyway? Where did I find this one — off the rack at Macy's? Is that why it has never seemed to really fit me? Parts of me seem to have gone missing. I feel adrift." "Do I feel fully alive? And, what would "fiilly alive" feel like? What's in myway? Who's in myway? Could it be me? Is it too late?" 
The Purposes "I want to fully meet, grow in, and love this life, the one I'm in, instead of some 'other' or 'better' one I've imagined." "I want clarity. I want to let go of my stories. I want to find My Missing Peace." 
The Outcomes • I've sought, rediscovered, acknowledged, taken responsibility for and reclaimed ownership of - all of myself. • I've reconnected with my deepest core values, and have committed to live in sync with them. • I'm becoming whole again. It feels really good. 
Together, in this highlighted version of the original workshop, we will seek, rediscover, acknowledge, and take responsibility for and ownership of all of our individual self. We will commit to living in synchronicity with our deepest core values. We will work to become whole again.

In Melissa's career she has witnessed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients facing the end with regrets and unforgiving hearts. Havinga hospital based chaplain administer last rites, or pray with a patient is a main spiritual practice within western medicine. Yet Melissa knows we are capable of much more. She has sought to enhance spirituality in healthcare by implementing mindfulness practices, offering Attitudinal HealingPrinciples, and incorporating a depth spiritual assessment within the outpatient clinic setting. 
Having been on her death bed, and having experienced significant personal loss, workshop leader Melissa Heckman knows the importance of finding meaning in life. In this workshop several scholarly articles will be cited along with tools for clinicians, spiritually-based coaches, and healing arts professionals.

We can change those beliefs - and subsequent thoughts, feelings, and actions, thus holding the key to our own imprisoned state - an enormously empowering fact! 
Peace of mind - awareness of absolute safety - results from replacing the programmed, fear-inducing selfappraisal of inadequacy, common to almost everyone, with a more helpful and accurate perception of ones self and others. We will explore the necessary steps for replacing fear-based beliefs with love: healing relationships, releasing defenses and grievances, living without resistance, following guidance, and choosing again daily. The resulting release of guilt and fear allows for the resolution of all difficulties and freedom to accept our birthright - living happily and freely.

We will focus on in-depth skills and working tools to enhance facilitation, communication, inner guidance, listening presence and joining with others. Participants will have the opportunity to experience the sacredness of support as an innate quality of our humanity. The heart of Attitudinal Healing, is the heart. Our true nature to connect and expand our awareness of the inner world and the world around us is a journey of intimacy, authenticity and compassion. The Principles of Attitudinal Healing hold the essence of community by fostering universal truths, one of which is to reach out and be of service to one another. We will explore and experience basic psychological, philosophical, and loving mandates which support the heart to be a resilient and vibrant center. 
Pre-requisite: Facilitator Training and minimum of three months facilitation experience. 
  
Cost: $75 
For more information and/or registration, please visit www.ahinternational.org.The Facilitator Training is designed for AH facilitators as well as those wanting to learn AH group facilitation. It is filled with experiential exercises to develop your skills and to learn new ones. Eighty percent of the time will be in small groups practicing different tools and skills demonstrated and taught by four women with the combined experience of 90 years facilitating Attitudinal Healinggroups. 
You will learn about the components of an AH group and have a chance to role play a facilitator in each one: pre-meeting, the opening of the group, the group process, the closing and post-meeting. Some of the tools that will be covered are reflective listening, creative ways to bring in the principles ofAttitudinal Healing, learning questions that can bring the group into Attitudinal Healing, and how to get the group back on track when the participants have lost interest and focus. Learn what makes an AH group different from an emotional support group.

For more information and/or registration, please visit www.ahinternational.org.Is this statement true? As wonderfully explored by Joseph Campbell, virtually every religion and culture in the world has intuited that we are all connected to some universal energy. And we now know from quantum physics that this is a scientific fact. If this universal energy is not love, why do these same cultures all conclude that the way to live a satisfying and meaningful life is to be in service with others? Isn't love a word for the glue that connects and brings people together? So if science, religion and academic study now show that we and everything in our universe is essentially energetic glue, perhaps this Age of Aquarius is the time for us to conduct our lives from this frame of reference. This workshop will explore these concepts with a view to helping each other find our own path to live from this place of loving connectedness.

*Medals will be shipped out in October.Through the years of working with children's groups with traumatic loss and grief, we have learned at Cecura Guadalajara that any loss in our childhood or even everyday incidents are imprinted in our body, mind and spirit, resulting in behavioral patterns that modify our perception of life and relationships that can last throughout our lives. The purpose of this workshop is to help the participants see through their own eyes the appropriate tools to heal the traumatic experiences printed in us and to rebound to a different perception. Learning these abilities, the participants can use their experience to help children to solve their grief at an early stage of life through Attitudinal Healing groups. This workshop is offered in English and Spanish.

Social Innovators From Around the Globe Prepare to Celebrate the 40th Anniversary of Highly Respected Bay Area Non-Profit 
website: www.ahinternational.org ~ email:  conference@ahinternational.org 
On September 19-21, 2014, a very special International Conference will gather hundreds of social innovators from around the world in the historic Presidio at the Golden Gate Club to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of Attitudinal Healing and pioneer future global adaptations of this work. The Conference celebrates the founder Dr. Gerald Jampolsky's 90th year. 
In 1975, in Tiburon, California Gerald Jampolsky M.D. introduced a pioneering approach to health and well-being called Attitudinal Healing. For four decades in the San Francisco Bay Area and over 30 countries, Dr. Jampolsky's widely recognized, award-winning, replicable model has helped children, adults and families from diverse cultures to find inner peace and resilience when facing illness, loss and other life challenges. All Attitudinal Healing support services continue to be free of charge. 
The conference will host 30 International Conference Speakers as well as 20+ Pre-Conference Workshops in both half and full-day formats. Continuing Education Units (CEUs) are available. 
In addition to Attitudinal Healing International’s co-founders Gerald Jampolsky M.D. and Diane Cirincione Jampolsky Ph.D., speakers include recognized authors, medical professionals, entrepreneurs and international lecturers such as Gary Zukav (author of best seller Seat of the Soul & frequent guest of Oprah), Frederic Luskin Ph.D. (founder of the Stanford Forgiveness Project) , Carol Howe (author and international lecturer), Leni Miller (author and Bay Area entrepreneur) Dean Ornish M.D. (physician, professor and founder of Preventive Medicine Research Institute) and Rinaldo Brutoco J.D. (successful entrepreneur, futurist and founder of World Business Academy),  The artistic director is Gary Malkin, multiple Emmy award-winning composer and performer. 
Carlos Santana and Cindy Blackman Santana are honorary co-chairs of the Saturday evening celebration which includes a reception, award presentations, dinner and music by internationally recognized Bay Area musicians, Freddy Clarke and Wobbly World.We need your voice. What you do, what you're passionate about, and what you believe in matters. The media shape the way we perceive the world, crucial issues, ourselves, and each other. We must be a central part of that narrative. 
In this workshop, we will focus on: 
*Speaking and writing with confidence, authority, and expertise  
*Getting your message out in an engaging and effective way 
*Promoting your work with pride and confidence 
*The power of telling our stories 
You will walk away with: 
*Renewed confidence, encouragement, and inspiration 
*A concrete set of goals 
*Tools to deal with writer's block, conflict, and self-doubt 
*New insights and perspectives on the power of finding and using our voices 
Why is this needed? Because women make up 51% of the population, but our voices are missing in the national dialog: 
*The guests on the Sunday morning political shows are overwhelmingly conservative, white, and male, according to Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR); In one-on-one interviews, 70% of partisan-affiliated guests are Republican, white (92%), and male (86%) 
*Male guests widely outnumbered female guests (730 to 285) on the major cable news shows over a recent five-week period, according to a FAIR survey. Just five percent (46) were women of color. 
*Approximately 85% of op-eds in the major dailies are written by men 
*Of the 143 columnists writing for the nation's top three newspapers and four syndicators, just 38 are women, according to Gawker.com 
*Men were quoted 3.4 times more often than women in Page 1 stories published in the New York Times during January and February 2013, according to a University of Nevada at Las Vegas analysis (breaking down the numbers, women were quoted in 465 of 2,411 news articles -- that's just 19%) 
*In 2012, women wrote 27% of stories in the Nation; 26% in the New Yorker; 16% in Harper's; and a mere 12% in the New York Review of Books, according to VIDA: Women in Literary Arts 
*The 2012 finalists for the National Magazine Awards failed to include one woman (not one!) 
*On National Public Radio, women represented only 26% of all sources in 2010 
*Women comprised 36% of staffers at 978 daily newspapers, a figure that has remained unchanged since 1999, according to the 2013 American Society of News Editors Newsroom Census 
In order to change these statistics, we need your voice!  
Testimonials from past attendees: 
"I walked away feeling empowered about myself and ready to promote the work I do without feeling like I'm showing off (which men do all the time)." -Saba G 
"I loved meeting with and learning from so many like-minded women. I was also inspired by Rose's stories and am looking forward to using the tools she shared withu us. This workshop pushed me outside of my comfort zone and opened my mind to new ideas and new ways of using my voice. Highly recommended!" - Jessica Schimm, assistant editor, Women 2.0  
"This workshop woke me up to see how desperately women's voices need to be heard today. It was powerful to hear stories about how women unconsciously discredit and doubt themselves, despite their accomplishments. I now feel more confident in my own ability to speak with authority and impact others." -Christina Cunnison 
"These tools are crucial. This workshop made me realize that I often sell myself short and am afraid to speak my mind for fear I won't be taken seriously. No more second guessing myself." -Anna SLEVEL: ADVANCED. ONLY OPEN TO STUDENTS WHO HAVE TAKEN SUSHI CLASS-ROll AND CLASS-NIGIRI, OR HAVE BEEN GRANTED SPECIAL PERMISSION.

Testimonial from previous versions of this workshop: 
  
Your workshop left me inspired by the possibility of making work on many levels.  I am a writer, dancer, and choreographer but haven't yet put them all together.  I am so many things.  Learning from your process of intertwining the two disciplines will surely move me along with putting all the pieces of me together in a more meaningful way in order to make my own work happen.

Hands-On Skills Application, Course Review, and GraduationHistorian and author Robert  Pavlik discusses his new book, Norman Clyde: Legendary Mountaineer of California's Sierra Nevada.  This riveting account of one of the most notable personalities of the mountain climbing world reconstructs the life of legendary mountaineer Norman Clyde (1885-1972). He made his mark on history with more than one hundred and thirty first ascents throughout western North America, and many believe he knew the High Sierra better than anyone else, including John Muir. Part of his mystique comes from participating in high-profile mountain rescues and recoveries, in which he is credited with saving a number of lives. Those who had the good fortune to meet him–often with a ninety-pound pack on his back that included an anvil for boot repair, fishing rods, cooking pots, and books in Greek and Latin–never forgot the experience. Biographer Robert C. Pavlik uses Clyde’s own words, along with recollections from his family, friends, fellow climbers, and acquaintances, to capture the experiences of a remarkable man and a bygone time “between the pioneers and the rock climbers.”Objective is to provide a forum for women interested in the Leadership and Management, focused on mutual growth and sharing of knowledge through informal meetings, networking and mentoring.

(for the 3day event events add more inforamtion to explain that it last 3 days)Who are you missing in your recruitment?: Diverse talent is out there you just have to know where to look
 
We often hear that diversity is a problem in tech and that big companies should do better at hiring people from different backgrounds and we all rally and say 'Yes, Google and Apple and Facebook should do better at that'. But what about the little guy? They need more talent and want to reach a large customer base too, right? So why not improve hiring in a way that reflects the changing demographics—42% of the US will be Black and Latino/a by 2040?  
 
Well, that's just too hard to think about as a startup, right? As a startup founder just scrapping by, looking for your next funder, the last thing you want on your plate is the daunting task of hiring software engineers. 
 
So your options are: 
 
1. Do the work yourself and worry about hiring until after 'this one big project is done'. 
2. Send an email (or Facebook) blast to your friends and you hire one of them.
3. Post your job description on a listserv and cross your fingers.
4. Attend this class and find out what hides behind door number 4. 
  
In this class we will explore what steps you can take to hit two bottom lines: 1. hiring talented coders and 2. creating a team filled with people from a variety of backgrounds.
 
This class blow your mind with a new perspective on how small businesses can—with just as much effort as #1, #2 and #3 above—increase diversity on their team now and not wait until they become the 'Google, Apple, & Facebook's of the world.

I will work with you individually in a hands-on, step-by-step fashion, guiding you from start to finish. I will focus on aspects of the process including composition, drawing, color, value and paint handling. The workshop goal is that you’ll leave with the confidence and knowledge to continue to develop as a plein air painter.

Mark Batson Baril, Resologics 
It took Mark 30 years and three successful businesses to clarify his passion for conflict resolution. He’d been on teams with companies including Lockheed Martin, 3M, GE Healthcare, Burton Snowboards, PALL Corporation and Medtronic producing everything from flexible-circuits and medical devices to high-volume packaging and sporting goods products before realizing that fostering productive relationships was his favorite type of project. It was then that he traded his spreadsheets and drawings for his current toolkit: proactive conflict prevention support, capacity building, team coaching and dispute management. Mark has a MS in Mediation and Applied Conflict Studies, is an experienced non-attorney mediator and a contract Ombudsman.

www.ezcertifications.comTechnology is the primary driver of economic growth today. Many people love their iPhone, iPads, Wi-Fi and “smart” homes. But is there an unexamined assumption within this technological boom?

At this Monthly Gathering, Jeromy Johnson will share with you the latest research on the health effects of electro-magnetic fields (EMF). What he has to share will certainly make you think twice about how your children and grandchildren use technology. More importantly though, he will be providing you with practical solutions. Jeromy is not anti-technology in anyway. He is simply advocating that technology be used safely and he will show you effective ways to do so.

~ Follow us on Twitter ~I LOVE LUCY® LIVE ON STAGE is the brand-new hit stage show adapted from the most beloved program in television history! America’s favorite foursome – Lucy, Ricky, Fred and Ethel – is live on stage and in color for the very first time!  It’s 1952 and you are a member of the studio audience awaiting the filming of two hilarious and oh-so-familiar I LOVE LUCY® episodes. Imagine stepping back in time onto the Desilu Playhouse soundstage where a charming host entertains and enlightens you to the behind-the-scenes filming process, the 1950s hi-fidelity technology and this brand-new thing called “television.” The episodes begin and you witness, firsthand, the side-splitting antics of that crazy redhead in the Ricardo’s New York apartment and thrill to the Cuban sounds of “The Ricky Ricardo Orchestra” at the famed Tropicana Nightclub. In-between scenes? The Crystaltone Singers perform live advertising jingles of the show’s newest sponsors in perfect 50s style harmony. Can you say “Brylcreem?!”  L.A. Examiner’s Ron Irwin says I LOVE LUCY® LIVE ON STAGE is “an absolutely brilliant and utterly engaging tribute to that iconic television show!” TV Guide’s William Keck calls it “the most entertaining stage production I’ve seen in years – including Broadway!”Artists of different media. Artists of different scale. Artists of different edges. Artist from different places.  
Come join us in a night of waves, vogue and beats with edgy Filipino artist from San Francisco, New York and Seattle.

Carla Sta Cruz 
The objective of Carla Sta. Cruz is to draw inspiration from the masters of design, and to redefine, reinvent, and adapt their classic silhouettes in a changing, technology-driven world. At the forefront is an audience of people who define and change the world as well-- the innovators, the dreamers, the changemakers. 
This is the audience Carla Sta. Cruz designs for. 
Chief designer Carla Sta. Cruz began conceptualizing and illustrating bags and clothes while a student in Parsons. When she began selling bags out of her apartment, Carla lovingly coerced friends and family to buy her products. Soon word of mouth spread, and she now has an intimate group of minions who passionately translate her vision into reality.

Kristian Kabuay 
Christian’s art is focused on the ancient writing system from the Philippines called Baybayin. It was nearly extinct due to colonization and is being brought back by Christian and a few other young Filipino-Americans. As a leading authority for the propagation and instruction of the script, he developed a modern style of the writing system called Tulang Kalis (Poetry of the Sword) and recently introduced it as Filipino Calligraphy with a series of live demonstrations and lectures at the Asian Art Museum this past October 2012. He has spoken at Stanford, Berkeley, SF State, Davis, Sonoma State and the University of the Philippines.The Center for Joint Preservation is pleased to present their Second Annual Cartilage Symposium.

San Francisco, California USA  
   
Agenda (in progress)  
  

21st Century KM  
In today’s post-informational and post-industrial society, Knowledge Management (KM) is enjoying a stunning renaissance. Knowledge creation and usage is leading many of the modern priorities of business, government and civil society. 
The 21st Century Knowledge Management Conference in San Francisco on May 15th 2014 is the global Action Research Conference for future-focused knowledge management (KM). All are welcome. 
The 21st Century Knowledge Management Conference is for leaders and professionals eager to participate in the next great episode of growth and prosperity in the Knowledge Era. KM2014 Delegates will strive to unlearn the past, focus on people and truly shape the future of knowledge work.  
Your 21st Century Knowledge Management Conference is designed for professionals, entrepreneurs, investors, scholars and leaders of all organizations and agencies active in the knowledge economy. KM2014 reveals and expands the leading practices of 21st Century KM, knowledge leadership and innovation.  
Some of the most dramatic, obvious and impactful characteristics of 21st Century KM and our emerging Knowledge Society are –   
• Producing ideas is the main way to grow business and the economy; 
• Knowledge creation is the essential business and innovation capability; 
• Transformation from material goods to broad knowledge-based services; 
• Knowledge workers and the creative class are the new leaders and propel innovation; 
• Sociology, biological and behavioral science subsumes information technologies for sense-making, knowledge creation, innovation, growth and prosperity. 
The knowledge era of Google, Wikipedia, Hadoop, SalesForce.com smartphones and so forth has fundamentally altered knowledge creation, business, government and civil society. Great vigor, interest and appetite for perpetual knowledge creation puts 21st Century KM squarely in the forefront of productivity, innovation and prosperity. 
Where do we see this dramatic shift? How do you advance in the Knowledge Era? What are the four realms of 21st Century knowledge and KM? What are the future-focused themes that you must master today? 
 
The four realms of Authentic, 21st Century KM are drawn from sociological, biological, behavioral and technological breakthroughs of our post-informational era. They are summarized here with examples of key action research themes for your 21st Century Knowledge Management Conference. 
• Sociological principles and advancements are essential to advanced sense-making, social media, networks and business. Techniques such as social network analysis and business ecologies are critical to optimal knowledge flow. 
• Biological factors of brain science, living systems and evolutionary development (evo-devo) reveal and create conditions for optimal knowledge sharing and creation. Neuromodulators like oxytocin propel KM and the emerging field of NeuroBusiness. 
• Behavioral innovations like mindfulness, storytelling and narrative are the foundations of Authentic KM. Complexity is a joyful and essential property to be embrace for flourishing knowledge creation and prosperous knowledge ecologies. 
• Technological breakthroughs are ushering in the era of cognitive computing. Mid-Century Von Neumann architectures are giving way to algorithmic big data and social computing to fundamentally advance knowledge creation and KM. 
All of these realms are a stark and astonishing departure from the failing KM Establishment. Their parochial information-centered practices of the past are no longer relevant. 
Join your colleagues, communities and KM networks for your 21st Century Knowledge Management Conference to embrace the Knowledge Era and above all Create the Future! 
  
  

 Further Background 
   
The knowledge enterprise is undergoing massive transitions. There are five enormous enterprise mega-shifts shaping 21st Century Leadership. These fundamental enterprise shifts are all happening all at once. These shifts are:   
  

Hierarchy to Networks – Complex systems thinking and network ecosystem logic propels the knowledge enterprise into the future. Traditional process-oriented organizations are being subsumed by the network mindset. Dynamic networks structures, patterns and exchanges incorporate and replace hierarchy.    
Governance to Relevance – Traditional governance is being replaced by fine-grain distributed relevance. Perpetually acting on behalf of customers propels enterprise achievement and business growth.   
Management to Leadership – Leadership behaviors of cultivate, collaborate and coordinate are replacing long-standing management traditions of measurement, command and control. Constitutions and narratives are supplanting metrics and consequences for high-level knowledge enterprise achievement.  
Transactions to Interactions – Work that was once systematic and routine is now knowledge-based. Work is social, interactive and improvisational. Success requires judgment, freedom, trust and continuous, complex interactions with diverse actors.  
Bureaucracies to Boundaries – Innovation, productivity and prosperity inhabit far-flung organization boundaries and just beyond. Central bureaucracies are losing relevance and are being dismantled. Knowledge 'on the edge' carries the day. 

Taken alone, any one of these enterprise mega-shifts is challenging. Taken together, simultaneously, they feel almost impossible. Fortunately, all these shifts are where humans excel... if they are allowed. 
On Oct 2 2014 in San Francisco join enterprise leaders, executives, technologists, professors, investors, entrepreneurs, authors and experts to shape the Knowledge Enterprise of the Future. 
Please accept your invitation to Knowledge Management 2014: 21st Century Knowledge Leadership and register today. 
Equip yourself with the methods, techniques, tools, technologies and Next Practices to master the next great chapter of enterprise prosperity.

3. Security: This team will help with crowd control. During large events, it's nice to have help with keeping our volunteers and residents calm and organized as there is an order to the day. SFCI prides itself in making sure the community is blessed on this day and needs security to make sure this happens smoothly. We need strong, orderly, yet kind volunteers for this job. 
4. Groceries: This group will prepare and pass out over 500 bags of groceries to Tenderloin residents. 
5. Kids Christmas Party: We will have our volunteers host a Christmas party for the kids of the community. Over 300 kids will get lunch and toys for Christmas and the rest of the families will get hot meals and groceries. Come and help make this a Christmas they will never forget! 
6. Meal Prep: This will be held in two locations. Each location is half a block away from each other. This whole event is based on getting hot Christmas dinners to 5,000 people who have signed up in advance for these meals. The meal delivery job is an assembly line formation and there is always a lot of energy in this team. If you are planning on bringing kids, this is a fun place for them to help and there is usually more space for them to roam.  
Location 1 - 230 Jones Street:  is located on Jones Street the main campus of SF City Impact between Eddy St and Turk Street. The meal prep area can accommodate up to 50 people. 
Location 2 - TBD 
7. Meal Delivery: These groups hand deliver all of the prepared food to the residents. All deliveries are done by foot. Vehicles are not necessary; however, if there are a few people that would like to drive, please let your leader know on that day. They will arrange for your group to take the meals that are furthest away. Families and those who don't want to be confined to one area love this task. All meals are carried in banana boxes to the assigned buildings. 
Often times, it might seem as if you're waiting around, however, this is the nature of the job. ALL the Meal Prep teams are doing their best to pump out the meals. So please be patient. This job is vital to getting the job done! 
8. Community Host/Ushers: This team will be the group who will host and usher our community guest into our block party. We have a 15 minute service to introduce SFCI and celebrate and encourage them as they come in. 
9. Registration/Greeters: This team helps greet those standing in line to receive groceries and meals. We would like volunteers who are outgoing and like to meet new people. This is a great time to get to know the people in the lines and spend time chatting with them to make the time go by faster as they wait. 
10. Get Connected:  A designated group of people who will meet all the residents and help them by offering them prayer and referrals to places they might need. 
  
We hope you have a great time and let's make this a holiday that the 
 Tenderloin Community won't ever forget!

If you are planning to produce apparel or sewn products, this session is for you! In an interactive and supportive environment, you’ll learn how to set-up and manage your own manufacturing operation or use contract manufacturers. 
We will cover key considerations including: 
• Assessing your needs and what makes the most sense for your particular business 
• Information and referrals to local factories and manufacturing resources 
• Acquiring facilities and where to look 
• Zoning and Permitting Issues 
• Obtaining financing 
• Addressing legal issues and documentation requirements 
• Overcoming specific roadblocks and challenges 
• Making valuable connections with your local manufacturing community 
  
Presenter: Janet Lees, Senior Director, SFMadeCan we be actively engaged in the leadership of reshaping social justice, environmental sustainability, and spiritual fulfillment through commerce? 
What are the assumptions that are obstacles to true transformation in advertising? 
From branding’s frontline to marketing’s frontier, is it possible to collaborate and reframe this conversation from the drawing board to the boardroom to the global table?  
Given the influence, saturation, and variety of platforms for delivering brand messaging, it is curious that in these critical times we have not fully harnessed advertising to reimagine social norms. 
Our thesis: transformative advertising has the opportunity to shape and influence the world.  While we are changing the conversation, it is imperative that we  change our practices along the way. 
The Transformative Advertising Summit is a one-day guided experiment.  (Don’t worry, there won’t be any lab coats or chemicals, just high-voltage ideas.)  
On Wednesday, January 21st: in session with 149 other pragmatic idealists, visionaries, CMO’s and top-level agency creatives, we will define and explore transformative storytelling.  
The 2015 Summit is made possible with content support and hosting by The Pachamama Alliance, and will feature keynote speaker, John Raatz from GATE. 
In addition, we will spotlight case studies of transformative messaging from top agencies, including Goodby,Silverstein& Partners, Ogilvy, and Citizen Group. All are actively honoring the greater good, applying a “triple bottom-line” philosophy, and making clients very happy. 
You rebels, dreamers, seekers, and sages: share your thoughts and ideas, and continue the transformation. Permission granted to make comments before and after the summit on  Join The Conversation.  
Better yet, say it in person on January 21st in San Francisco.

About the film: From John Muir in the 1860s to the super athletes of today, Vertical Frontier is the character-driven story of the art, sport and philosophy of climbing the legendary big walls of Yosemite. 
Illustrated by spectacular old and new footage shot on those granite walls, the story is told by the climbers. Their ranks include David Brower, Royal Robbins, Yvon Chouinard, Jim Bridwell, Lynn Hill, Hans Florine, Dean Potter and many more. They climb with artistry and sheer determination. They hold a strong attachment to the climbing traditions established in the Valley and a deep respect for the climbers that created them and went on to influence climbing and mountaineering worldwide. 
Nowhere is the expression of this way of life more pronounced than at Camp 4. Looking east, toward Half Dome, the morning sun reaches Camp 4 before any other campground in the Valley. For the climbers, this dusty, boulder-strewn campground is their mecca, their gathering place...and often their home. In 1997, the "flood of the century" wiped out housing and lodging around Yosemite Valley. When Camp 4, the heart of early rebel rock climbing culture, faces development by the National Park Service, a dream team of veteran climbers joins forces to save it. The story concludes as the climbers celebrate Camp 4 being named eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. (Editor’s Note: Camp 4 was officially placed on the National Register of Historic Places in February 2003.)Infusion Lounge Guest ListSan Francisco

MORE QUESTIONS? Contact us directly with the subject line "CPR Inquiry"As part of the Attitudinal Healing Conference, Spiritual teacher and author, Carol Howe will be presenting a one-day work shop based on her 8-part DVD series, "See How Life Works."  
Centered around relationships, which cause much of our emotional suffering, this workshop is designed to explore the necessary steps for replacing fear-based beliefs with love: healing relationships, releasing defenses and grievances, living without resistance, following guidance, and choosing again daily. The resulting release of guilt and fear allows for the resolution of all difficulties and freedom to accept our birthright - living happily and freely.  
We are victims ONLY of our programmed attitudes and conditioning, held hostage by powerful, often unconscious beliefs. We can change those beliefs - and subsequent thoughts, feelings, and actions, thus holding the key to our own imprisoned state - an enormously empowering fact!   Peace of mind - awareness of absolute safety - results from replacing the programmed, fear-inducing self-appraisal of inadequacy, common to almost everyone, with a more helpful and accurate perception of one’s self and others.

Juried by Adrian Arleo  October 4 - November 15, 2014  
Those of us who create figurative art are tied to a 40,000 year old tradition beginning with cave paintings, and carved human and animal figures of the Ice Age. People of that period would likely find it impossible to navigate our world, yet their art, across a distance of four hundred centuries, still has the power to speak to us and tap into some essential common humanity.  
In ceramic sculpture, the figure continues to be used as a receptacle to convey experience, from self-portraiture, to personal visions and passions, to commentary on popular culture and politics, from the love of the body as a beautiful form, to the apotheosis of the grotesque. Every artist has a unique perspective and a unique touch. Add to this the malleability of clay and the very handling of the material becomes an integral part of the form and content. As a genre, figurative ceramic sculpture is the most diverse it's ever been, embracing traditional sculptural techniques, ephemeral installations, industrial multiples, digital imagery (to name a few), while reflecting on the past, processing the present and conjuring the future.  
Clay must be the primary material, but may include mixed media, installation and video.Ain't Misbehavin'  Music by Thomas "Fats" Waller. Conceived by Murray Horwitz and Richard Maltby, Jr.

This program is open to the public. Advance registration required by Monday, September 15.Please join us for a tour of 10 East North Avenue, the former Centre Theater, on Tuesday September 9th, 2014. A key addition to the Station North Arts & Entertainment district, the flexible building design will accommodate a variety of tenants, including the Center for Neighborhoods and the new joint Film Program for Maryland Institute College of Art & Johns Hopkins University.  
The historic building was constructed in 1913 as a two-story automobile dealership and was converted by Morris Mechanic in 1930s to a theater and radio studio. It opened its doors as the Centre Theater in 1939, welcoming guests into a 1,000-seat auditorium. The building was also home to the WFBR-AM radio station. After the theater’s closure in 1959, it was converted into a bank and the art deco theatre volume was infilled to provide space for offices. The building has been abandoned for several years, and is currently in a state of disrepair. 
The project was awarded $3 million in Maryland Sustainable Communities Tax Credits as a result of the goal to restore the building envelope and structure per State and Federal historic preservation guidelines and meet Baltimore City Green Building Standards. The two outward facing facades on North Avenue and 20th Street will be restored, as well as the original theater marquee. New windows and roofs will be installed alongside energy-efficient building envelope improvements. A new building core with stairs and elevators creates efficient and flexible tenant space. 
Current plans for the 73,000 sf building include spaces for film screenings, music venues, artists’ studios, galleries, a playhouse and a restaurant. 
Team members from Southway Builders Inc., Jubilee Baltimore and Ziger / Snead will be hosting us to provide insight into this building’s fascinating history and its new plans to continue serving North Avenue and the Station North Arts & Entertainment district.  
Presented by the AIABaltimore Historic Resources Committee / Baltimore Architecture Foundation Sponsored by Southway Builders, Inc.

Y of Central MarylandProject Management (PMP)Online Free Webinar on 
"Project Risk Management" 
August 19, 2014 03:00 PM CDT/USA 
Register Now  
Project risk management is an important aspect of project management. This webinar session will inform us how to identify, analyse and respond to risk factors throughout the life cycle of a project. 
ISO 31000 has introduced some important and more pertinent terms to the risk management standard and hence helps in better orchestration and implementation of the process across the organization to yield benefits whilst at the same time controlling the costs and the overall optimization of resources.  
Risk owner is defined as a “person or entity with the accountability and authority to manage a risk.” This definition will help the risk manager reinforce to management that risk ownership must be with management and not with the risk manager.  
Risk appetite is an area that many organizations struggle with and whilst risk appetite, is not defined in ISO 31000 (it is in ISO Guide 73:2009), the Standard defines risk attitude as the organization’s “approach to assess and eventually pursue, retain, take or turn away from risk”.  
Risk management policy is also defined as a “statement of the overall intentions and direction of an organization related to risk management”. 
The risk management plan should specify the “approach, the management components and resources to be applied to the management of risk.” 
ISO has released ISO Guide 73:2009 Risk management – Vocabulary to provide further guidance with respect to generic terms and definitions relating to risk management to support consistency. 
Hurry and enroll for this free online project management courses session. Enroll early to confirm your spot.

At the workshop, you'll learn some basic stitches (and even some fancy ones, like French knots). Artists will help you transfer personal or found images (bring them with you or create on the spot), and you'll start stitching on a mini-sampler of your own! You will also have the opportunity to participate on a large group piece, in collaboration with other workshop'ers. Get inspired by the work of Make Studio artists and make something in response! Both children and adults are welcome (we’ll even have a tapestry table for the littlest family members). All other materials will be provided. We encourage you to register early to secure a spot, but walk-ins are also welcome, and attendees do not have to stay for the entire length of the workshop. 
The two-person show “Gathered Strands” will also be on view in the studio for the month of October and will feature the work of Make Studio artists Erika Clark and Bess Lumsden. The finished collaborative piece from the workshop will be displayed at the closing reception of “Gathered Strands”, taking place on October 24th. Workshop attendees are encouraged to return to the studio to see and celebrate the final results of their collaboration!

at Gallery 788 and The Baltimore Free Farm (10/3 - 10/5) 
Mushroom City Art Festival 2014 will be an interactive exploration of the Mushroom as an organism: focusing on its impact on our ourselves and our environment. Discussions, art, music, workshops and walking tours will reveal the many real world applications for mushroom cultivation in contemporary urban life. 
Workshops and talks will be held Saturday and Sunday and the Mushroom City Art exhibit will remain at Gallery 788 until Sunday, 10/26. 
 Why Mushroom City Art Festival?  The mushroom, often portrayed only as a food product, plays a remarkable role in developing and sustaining the environment. Mycelium, the underground root-like network of mushrooms, plays a critical role in maintaining healthy soil by absorbing and processing toxins, heavy metals, and even synthetic substances such as plastic or oil, and converting them into useful organic nutrients.  Mycelium, structured-like neurons in the brain or the branching of tree limbs, illustrates how interconnected structures exist in nature and on all levels of life. It's in learning how interconnected systems function that we see opportunities for growing and engaging the world. In our 21st century world, where our traditional methods of production, consumption, and interaction with the environment break down a little more each day, we can afford to widen our perspective and learn from the living world around us.  Through Mushroom City Arts, we hope to educate ourselves and one another by exploring both the practical and the intuitive aspects of the mushroom. We hope you come and learn how this life form can inspire and help us move forward into a more sustainable future.    Mushroom City Art Festival Schedule

Let us build is the cry of a generation that has been denied the opportunity of living in a progressive and developed Nigeria. A country where 70% of the population are below 35 years old and the government doesn’t have a clear plan of harnessing the workforce of the future. 
Let us Build is a generational call to all well-meaning Nigerians “we cannot afford to do ‘nothing’ anymore”. We must break free from this mindset, and do something. We must instead lock ourselves up in the prison of hope, where nothing is impossible, guided by the conviction that justice, truth and growth must prevail in Nigeria, no matter how long it takes.   
Night to Build Gala is a global campaign to engage Nigerian citizens in the diaspora about the state of our country and what we need to do to ensure good governance and frame the key issues we need to address in order to build a developed nation. 
These event is for Nigerians who are ready to actualise the potentials of our country. The  generation that will define what the next hundred years of our existence as a nation would be.

At BARCS, the search for a home is everything - for every neglected cat or dog given up by its family, every kitten and puppy born into an already overpopulated world - home is the ultimate hope. It is thanks to the generosity from the dedicated friends of BARCS who help thousands of abandoned animals leave as cherished pets for their forever homes each year. 
There are so many suffering, neglected and abandoned pets in Baltimore that still need our help. BARCS strives to save all healthy and treatable animals, but we can only accomplish this goal with your help. Every dollar raised from the Ready, Set, Sniff 5K goes directly toward the animals in our care.Kick off the 2014 football season with Ohio State against Navy!

Primo is designed for children with emerging or limited literacy skills, and lays the logical foundation necessary for early programming. Children use three wooden elements - an interface board, a rolling robot and a set of brightly colored instruction blocks that represent the code. Combining the blocks with the board allows the user to control the robot, thus creating very simple algorithms - using only shapes and colors.

A woman who would forever change her times. A woman whose story has never been told. A queen more powerful than Cleopatra, who defied the tradition of the age, ruled the throne beside her stepson, dressed up like a man, wore a false beard, claimed that she was born of immaculate conception and declared herself a god. In 2007 her royal mummy was found. This is the story of that woman... and the man who tried to erase her from history forever.Back by even more popular demand, our 3rd Annual Brony Bar Trot!

Tuesday, October 21 
9:00 - 10:00am 
660 Redwood Street, Howard Hall, Room 450 
  
Speaker: 
Christy Chang, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine, UMSOM 
  
Dr. Chang is the recipient of several NIH R01 awards for her work on the genetic and functional analyses of hypertension susceptibility genes.  Dr. Chang has also served as an NIH reviewer.  Dr. Chang combines these two perspectives to give junior faculty insights into how to write a competitive grant application.  In the current funding climate, when rates are low, it is crucial to develop an application that does more than present the facts.  Thus, Dr. Chang goes beyond the basics of presenting data to providing a scientific story based on the data.  The ability to get reviewers interested in your scientific story is the key to a fundable grant.2015 MISS MARYLAND UNITED STATES

Over the years, IT has become a vital part of business to the point where it would not be possible for many to function without it.  As a result of its increasing role, the IT function is changing, morphing from a technology provider to a strategic partner. In this session we would be analyzing on IT Governance and IT Service Management and understand the relationship between the both. 
While the benefits of applying IT Service Management practices vary depending on the organization’s needs, size, complexity, scale etc some typical benefits are:  • Improved quality service provision  • Cost-justifiable service quality  • Services that meet business, Customer and User demands  • Integrated centralized processes  • Everyone knowing their role and their responsibilities in service provision  • Learning from previous experience and  • Demonstrable performance indicators 
Service Quality is measured based on the user’s satisfaction level towards a service. It indicates the overall effect of service performance that determines the degree of satisfaction of a user of the service. The measure is derived from the ability of the resources to provide different levels of services.     Ask you questions and clarify your doubts with our expert during this session.

Register Now 
This webinar will help in understanding the relationship between Project Management and Six Sigma. It will also inform us how we can eliminate inordinate delays, time and cost overruns, user dissatisfaction and maintenance problems. It will also talk about software processes and best practices. 
Lean Six Sigma is a process improvement methodology that combines tools and methods of both Lean and Six Sigma, as the name implies. While Lean focuses on speed and flow, Six Sigma process focuses on quality (defects and process variation). Lean does not make a process stable or under statistical control. 
Integrating Six Sigma techniques with the project management methodologies is the way to go for companies focussing on continuous improvement. Many organizations implement Total Quality Management, Six Sigma, and Total Quality Control to assist in new product development, to reduce the cost of development, improve manufacturing efficiency or to enter new markets. Most organizations integrate the Six Sigma method to the project management tools and processes so as to gain maximum advantage. 
The DMAIC Six Sigma methodology i.e. Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control provides a structured approach to solving business issues. The tools used in Six Sigma are primarily to identify the root causes for process defects so that the company can provide to the customers consistent quality products on time and at low cost. The project management tools and techniques emphasis the project attributes such as development, control, completion etc.

Featured Youth Art Group: TwentyOneOsix (2106)Adrian Arleo is a ceramic sculptor living outside Missoula, Montana. She studied Art and Anthropology at Pitzer College (B.A. 1983) and received her M.F.A. in ceramics from Rhode Island School of Design in 1986. Arleo was an Artist in Residence at Oregon College of Art and Craft in 1986-87, and at Sitka Center For Art and Ecology in 1987-88. For nearly thirty years, Arleo has focused her work on the human ﬁgure, often combining it with animal imagery, and other elements of the natural world. Some works allude to a relationship of understanding or connection between the human and animal realms. In others, human ﬁgures possess animal features in a way that reveals something hidden about the character or primal nature of the human.Get your hands dirty and make cups for community!

Written by Jackie Sibblies Drury | Directed by Kellie Mecleary 
Set in an abandoned theatre after what may or may not be a zombie apocalypse, Social Creatures examines what happens after the after. When what’s left of humanity is rapidly transforming into bloodthirsty beasts, to whom can a good neighbor turn? Strangers become friends and friends swiftly become predators as the world crumbles, and, in the end, somebody’s definitely getting eaten.DESCRIPTION 
This 16mm workshop will take the participants step by step through a jazzy new photo-chemical technique which allows selectively controlled negative and positive colour and black and white images on the same strip of film. What’s more, the technique allows us to make these selection decisions in full light with the images visible right there in front of you. You can have areas of black, areas of clear, colour negative areas, colour positive areas and glorious black and white images all within a single frame of ordinary camera captured image. We then get to watch the colour chemistry working its magic—again, in full light. The workshop begins with a freshly made colour print of colour negative material. But instead of processing this print in the normal ECP process, we will be undertaking our novel processing sequence that will produce an odd looking positive black and white image on the film. We will then select various areas on that print that we want to end up as positive colour, negative colour, leave black and white or process as black or clear film. Those areas will be selectively covered with special chemical blocking tape. Then the film will be selectively bathed in an assortment of colour chemistry before removing the tape and bathing in more chemistry. As well as engaging with a great new experimental film technique, this workshop is a great opportunity to learn in detail how colour film works.

INSTRUCTORS  
Richard Tuohy is one of the most active experimental film artists currently working on celluloid in Australia. His film Iron-Wood won first prize (ex aequo) at the 2009 International Abstract Cinema Exhibition (ABSTRACTA) in Rome. He runs Nanolab in Australia—the specialist small gauge film processing laboratory. He actively encourages other artists to work with cine film through his Artist Film Workshop initiative. In 2006 he and his partner started Nanolab as an artist run film laboratory offering super 8 processing. 
As a young person Dianna Barrie found her way into filmmaking as a middle ground between the pursuit of abstract music and philosophy. Ever pushing the limits of the hand processing of Super 8 led to the establishment of Nanolab with Richard Tuohy, and into the intersection of hand making and industrial cinema technology. This exploration has spread beyond individual work to the establishment of Artist Film Workshop, where celluloid is embraced and advocated by a community of practitioners in Melbourne.  *Sight Unseen will also present a screening of Tuohy & Barrie's films at Current Space on Friday, October 24th, 2014.A Bruun Studios project, Autumn Leaves offers an oasis from a world too full of judgment, a city too full of fracture.

But now, new technologies allow us to not only read DNA sequences, but also to write the genetic code! Scientists now regularly custom design and then synthesize short DNA sequence and are pioneering techniques to assemble larger custom genes and genomes. This unprecedented ability to create and manipulate living organisms has opened new frontiers in our ability to create life in the lab.   In this 5-session “Build-a-Gene” class, we will learn and practice the techniques that synthetic biologists use in genome synthesis, including creation of synthetic genes, assembly of larger DNA fragments by Gibson Assembly, and the use of yeast cells for gene assembly. In addition to lab work, we will be discussing this brave new frontier in biological engineering- how this technology is currently being used to redesign cells and systems, and how society should respond to and regulate this new field. Join us as we learn to synthesize new genes from scratch!  The sessions are designed to give a good survey of synthetic biology techniques while doing an interesting project. While we encourage you to take as many sessions as you can,  since they are different steps in the project, each session can stand on its own.

The Common Core specifies some critical content, but many decisions are left up to the state and local levels. Join us for a discussion of why teaching content knowledge is important; how to teach it; and the implications for the Common Core State Standards with Robert Pondiscio and Dr. Marcy Stein on October 8, 2014 from 4:30pm – 6:30pm at Loyola University Maryland.

Our mission of multicultural arts promotion, ethnic diversity, and a positive image will resonate throughout the event, and we are proud to embark upon this endeavor. 
With a new year and a new goal in mind, the Boutique Bridal Extravaganza will also be incorporating some exciting additions to this event. The production will be facilitated to make every seat feel like a front row seat into the wedding of their dreams. Our venue, the Grand Historic Venue, is a luxury landmark located in the heart of Baltimore's inner harbor - one of the area's most beautiful rental venues - guaranteed to set the tone for this exquisite event. 
We look forward to continuing our great relationships with sponsors, designers, press, and all of our patrons.

 When Gabriela awakens to find her husband Benito has returned from a military tour, their lust and frustration reach a boiling point, sending the couple down a corkscrewing slide of marital strife, sexual tension, and hostility. A Cat, a Coyote, and The Moon help weave Rivera’s story in language poetic and grounded, sensual and sardonic, all against the sweltering backdrop of a barren summer wasteland.By Shawn Reddy  
The legend surrounding the white suit and its most famous wearers—Mark Twain and Colonel Sanders—is the cornerstone of this ridiculous examination of the iconic Southern uniform. A team of suit-wearers and a pompous professorial faux academic lead us through the bastardized history of both the suit and our country, with chicken. Lots of chicken.

The meeting starts PROMPTLY at 7:30 AM. 
Registration is requiredPain and suffering can't be avoided and sometimes come acutely. Fierce experiences are a part of life. Negative self-talk increases their effect, while positive self-talk keeps you calm. Use your words to turn negative thoughts into positive ones. Deal with stress through your self-talk. We all talk to ourselves, either out loud or in our heads. Your positive self-talk will reduce stress and help you deal with situations that cause you stress. Control your thoughts and words. Stress and anxiety can help us make the necessary changes in our lives and help us to act in our best interest. Everyone has feelings of nervousness, tension, and stress at times. Practice relaxation techniques to control your mind. Deep breathing helps the entire body let go and loosen up. Your mind and body must feel peaceful and strong in order to handle life's ups and downs. Keep your mind off of worry by focusing your thoughts on beautiful, happy, and positive things.   
    Hardships and pain are inevitable and will be encountered in everyone's life. At some point in our life, we will experience hardships, pain, and suffering, for no one can escape them. Prepared people aren't as badly affected by the inevitability of hardships as those who aren't prepared. How you deal with hardships defines your future. Hardships and suffering define your character and make you better. Pain and hardship give one an opportunity to grow as a person. They are impermanent and won't last. Nothing in our universe escapes impermanence. Keep the truth "it won't last" in your mind. Strength comes from realizing that other people are going through what you're going through.

The play incorporates specific issues of our time, from sexual abuse to insanity, yet goes beyond current topics to intimately explore universal themes such as aging, death, love and hope.

 Instructor: Dr. Pilar Jennings, Core Faculty Member, Four-Year Program Mondays, October 27, November 10, 17 and 24, December 8 & 15, 2014, 7:15-9:15 PM 
 Winter Retreat, Saturday December 20; 10AM-5PM 
  
The Nalanda tradition is precious because it integrates all Buddhist science and arts into a complete path of contemplative living, specially designed for lay practice in the everyday world. The map for this approach, called the Lam Rim or Gradual Path, fuses contemplative insights and skills of self-healing, social engagement and life-transformation into a continuous journey of three horizons.   This class surveys a gradual system of reflection on twelve basic facts of contemplative life, mapped into three main horizons of human development. The horizon of personal wellbeing begins with contemplating life and death; it confronts the laws of change and our need for reliable help & guidance. The horizon of social engagement begins with impartial concern for all life, weighs the costs of self-enclosure against the benefits of social engagement, and culminates in a life-shift from our reactive way of being in the world to one of proactive engagement. The horizon of transformation begins with recognizing the need for mentoring and culminates in awakening the creative powers of vision and inspiration.   The course guides students through the five-step process of meditation-based change: discursive learning, positive motivation, analytic reflection, focused contemplation, and practical application. Techniques addressed include combining analytic insight with concentrative quiescence, integrating cognitive, emotional and behavioral learning, and using mentors, imagery and breath-work to speed change.   This unique format covers everything you need to know about contemplative life, a step at a time, gradually unpacking the insights of self-healing, altruism and inspiration along with the methods of mindfulness, mind-clearing and role-modeling practice. The focus here is on understanding how this powerful system of reflective learning maps our journey from compulsion to freedom and shared happiness in ways that help us make tangible progress through gradual growth and life-change. 
 Newcomers with a sincere wish to explore your habitual worldview, mindset & lifestyle are warmly welcomed.

Embodying Your Spiritual Family Tree:  Heart Teachings on the Path to Bliss-Void Integration 
  
This four-part Nalanda Institute seminar introduces the art of spiritual re-parenting in the Nalanda tradition, considered by all Tibetan schools the most effective way of ripening our minds and nervous systems for blissful, altruistic engagement with all life and the earth we share.  By consciously upgrading our traumatic development with heroic imagery and affirmation, safe in the healing circle of a spiritual mentor family and community, this art catalyzes the alchemical rewiring we need to embody a blissfully integrated open self and world. We first unpack this art as the unexcelled vehicle for traveling the gradual path to blissful openness, the living-breathing womb in which we can naturally develop all four limbs we need for that path: mindful well-being, altruistic openness, healing vision, and sublime passion. We then explore its universal human logic and depth-psychological method, both in terms of Buddhist contemplative science and in terms of modern neuropsychology. Our journey is based on the heart teachings of the Ganden-Kagyu tradition of Tibet, as distilled in the masterful, all-encompassing practice of Mentor Devotion, by the first Panchen Lama, Losang Chokyi Gyaltsan. We also flesh out this practice with the spiritual biography of Tibet’s first home-grown Master Altruist, the beloved cotton-clad yogi Milarepa.

In this session we would be analyzing on IT Governance and IT Service Management and understand the relationship between the both. 
While the benefits of applying IT Service Management practices vary depending on the organization’s needs, size, complexity, scale etc some typical benefits are:  • Improved quality service provision  • Cost-justifiable service quality  • Services that meet business, Customer and User demands  • Integrated centralized processes  • Everyone knowing their role and their responsibilities in service provision  • Learning from previous experience and  • Demonstrable performance indicators 
Service Quality is measured based on the user’s satisfaction level towards a service. It indicates the overall effect of service performance that determines the degree of satisfaction of a user of the service. The measure is derived from the ability of the resources to provide different levels of services.     Ask you questions and clarify your doubts with our expert during this session.

Are you a female artist, healer or creative type, drowning in the 10,000 things you "could do" or "should do" to grow your biz? But just aren't sure what will actually make the difference in your bottom line?

 

Have you created success in your business through sheer will and perseverance, but are swamped by the volume of work just to get by, and don't know how to grow further without cloning yourself?

  
If you are ready to finally generate more money, doing what you love, and without burning out your adrenals, please join me for a workshop on Tuesday, October 14 from 9:30am - 12pm EDT, where I'll show you how to get 100% focused on the tasks that actually drive your revenue up. And hallelujah - forget the rest that don't! 
  
In this workshop, you'll get laser focused on: 

Overcoming the six biggest barriers to generating wealth in your business

 

How the Engine of Your Business Revenue works, and why you can't make money until you understand it

 

Diagnose which of the biggest revenue opportunities you can focus on to move your revenue up now

 

Why you feel overwhelmed and how to change this cycle for good

 

The two things you must spend the majority of time on, if you're not making enough money

 

Why your website is not really the problem, even though it feels like it

 
 
Seriously, don't miss this workshop. I know we are all so used to big, bold marketing messages trying to get us to show up, but this 4-part system is a game changer for your business.
  
I used this exact system to grow WINC's revenue by 18x in 9 months!  
  
And I've seen many women grow their revenue 2x, 3x, even 10x in just a few months. Results from women who've used this system... 
  

An acupuncturist, Noel Love, in WINC's Fall Program grew her revenue by 68% in the second month of the Program, and went from making around $2000 to $6700 a month. All in just four months!

 

A super talented jewelry designer, Mariele Williams, went from selling $300 a month and hustling as a waitress to pay bills to consistently selling $3000 a month of her jewelry after only 3 months! She quit her job and now works on her business full-time - and its just the beginning.

 

An incredible singer-song writer, Emma Back, grew her revenue 3x in the last six months!

 

Emma's mother, Katie Back, also in the Fall Program, generated the same revenue in 6 weeks that took her six months last year! And really amazing - she's working with her customers LESS at higher prices.

 

Dozens of women artists and healers at the very beginning of trying to build a business are now crystal clear about what their business is and does (Hallelujah!), and selling their new offerings that can actually make great money, rather than peanuts here and there.

  
You'll leave this workshop with a whole new understanding of where to focus and where not to focus, if you want to create wealth doing what you love.

Written by New York Times best selling author and Oprah book of the month club author, Joyce Carol Oates, I Stand Before You Naked is a powerful evening theater that explores "women oppressed by their husbands, their lovers, and themselves - a searing look at misplaced love, infidelity, prostitution, and the primal desire to be loved."  This extraordinary play by one of America's foremost women writers consists of 10 powerful stories, delivered by women in moments of confessional reflection. The play incorporates specific issues of our time, from sexual abuse to insanity, yet goes beyond current topics to intimately explore universal themes such as aging, death, love and hope.
 
  
This production is 90 minutes in length with no intermission.  There is no late seating.  Please be aware that the theater is located in the historic Producers Club's 2nd floor and that there is no elevator available.TALK SHOW 
Launching a revolution from her solo show "A View From the Bitch Seat," Lyssa Mandel welcomes guests to expose their own bleeding-heart adolescent artifacts (journal entries, poetry, original songs and art), then welcomes them to laugh at and with their own flaws. Because it's therapeutic. And it's a great learning experience. And because it worked wonders for HER. And hey, yolo. [Is shot from offstage, dies.]Beleza Brazil

 Instructor: Dr. Pilar Jennings, Core Faculty Member, Four-Year Program Mondays, October 27, November 10, 17 and 24, December 8 & 15, 2014, 7:15-9:15 PM 
 Winter Retreat, Saturday December 20; 10AM-5PM 
  
The Nalanda tradition is precious because it integrates all Buddhist science and arts into a complete path of contemplative living, specially designed for lay practice in the everyday world. The map for this approach, called the Lam Rim or Gradual Path, fuses contemplative insights and skills of self-healing, social engagement and life-transformation into a continuous journey of three horizons.   This class surveys a gradual system of reflection on twelve basic facts of contemplative life, mapped into three main horizons of human development. The horizon of personal wellbeing begins with contemplating life and death; it confronts the laws of change and our need for reliable help & guidance. The horizon of social engagement begins with impartial concern for all life, weighs the costs of self-enclosure against the benefits of social engagement, and culminates in a life-shift from our reactive way of being in the world to one of proactive engagement. The horizon of transformation begins with recognizing the need for mentoring and culminates in awakening the creative powers of vision and inspiration.   The course guides students through the five-step process of meditation-based change: discursive learning, positive motivation, analytic reflection, focused contemplation, and practical application. Techniques addressed include combining analytic insight with concentrative quiescence, integrating cognitive, emotional and behavioral learning, and using mentors, imagery and breath-work to speed change.   This unique format covers everything you need to know about contemplative life, a step at a time, gradually unpacking the insights of self-healing, altruism and inspiration along with the methods of mindfulness, mind-clearing and role-modeling practice. The focus here is on understanding how this powerful system of reflective learning maps our journey from compulsion to freedom and shared happiness in ways that help us make tangible progress through gradual growth and life-change. 
 Newcomers with a sincere wish to explore your habitual worldview, mindset & lifestyle are warmly welcomed.

 Hosted by international speakers and long-time devotees of Adi Da Samraj – Brian O’Mahony (author of the introduction to the book by Avatar Adi Da “The Gift of Truth Itself) and Antonina Randazzo – this seminar takes participants through an in depth discussion of Adi Da’s teaching as they share their experiences of being in his company over many years.  There will be video footage of Adi Da, contemplative recitatons, and sacred music. 
10 am to 4 pm 
$35.00 includes a copy of the book, The Gift of Truth ItselfInterest-based negotiation has now been on the collective bargaining scene for over 25 years. Not long after the 1983 publication of Fisher & Ury’s Getting to Yes, labor and management began experimenting with this “new and improved” approach to resolving conflict in the workplace. Now, after a quarter century of contract, grievance, and partnership application ‘the wheat has been separated from the chaff’ and a more realistic, sensible and practical version is the result. You’re invited to join us as TNI Faculty explore the latest thought leadership in labor and management negotiation in this groundbreaking one-day event, the 2014 TNI Art of Negotiating for Labor & Management Conference Getting to Real: A Practical Approach to Interest Based Labor and Management Negotiation. 
The Labor Management Relationship is largely defined by negotiation; bargaining contracts, resolving grievances, handling gripes, and sometimes working together in consultative fashion on topics which the parties are not bound to tackle, yet choose to do so for the betterment of the operation (labor/management cooperation). Think three-legged stool: one leg being contract bargaining, the second being contract administration, and the third being consultative negotiation. The manner in which these various negotiations are conducted not only impacts the quality of the deals themselves, but also the quality of the parties’ consequent relationship. That is to say, companies and their unions are either caught up in a vicious cycle (distrust leading to constrained communication resulting in sub-optimal solutions, further reducing trust, etc.) or are constructing a virtuous cycle (improved trust freeing up better communication resulting in higher quality deals further building trust, etc.). Depending upon where you are in your particular relationship, this seminar can help you break the vicious cycle or accelerate the virtuous cycle. The day will toggle back and forth between lecture and simulated negotiation exercises. Both grievance (individual) and contract/partnership (systemic) issues will be addressed in this fashion. The afternoon session will conclude with a “final exam” in which participants will be tasked with applying new skills, techniques and structures on a simulated contract issue.The Changing Role of the CFO: The Evolution from Finance Expert to Operational Leader Wednesday, September 10, 2014, 8:30 - 11:00 a.m. Aon, One Seaport Plaza, 199 Water Street, New York, NY 
  
The CFO role has evolved from a numbers cruncher/ accountant "finance expert" focused on past performance into that of a forward thinking performance leader looking at where the business is going. 
While CFOs are still focused on the bottom line, cash flows, controls, costs and risks, they also partner with the management team to seek profitable growth opportunities and help determine the direction of the company. Today's CFOs are becoming more operational and are performance leaders concerned with driving business indicators and performance metrics. 
Join the CFO RoundTable NYC for The Changing Role of the CFO: The Evolution from Finance Expert to Operational Leader where our panel will discuss how to take charge of this evolution and fully embrace your leadership position within your organization. 
Our panel discussion will feature the perspectives of CFOs, CEOs, and Board Members, all of whom will comment on the history of the CFO role and its evolution over thye past 5 - 10 years due to the regulatory landscape, expanding board expectations, and strategic endeavors. 
Confirmed speakers include:

 Final Retreat Instructors: Drs. Joe Loizzo, Miles Neale & Emily Wolf Saturday November 1, 2014 from 10-5 PM   Role-Modeling Imagery: The Fast Track to Self-Transformation 
  
Course 5 (Year Three, Course One) of the Nalanda Institute for Contemplative Science’s Four-Year Program introduces the art of role-modeling visualization in the Indo-Tibetan tradition, considered the quickest, most effective way of developing our innate genius for altruistic engagement with all life and the earth we share.  By binding our compassionate openness with heroic imagery and affirmation, safe in the crucible of a close mentor-student bond, this art catalyzes the alchemical change we need to create a new, ideal self and world. We begin by locating this art within the gradual path to sustainable happiness, reviewing the basic horizons of conscious self-regulation, universal compassion and radical openness that are assumed as vital prerequisites for its safe and optimal practice. We then unpack the distinctive logic and neuropsychological mechanism that make this ancient art so powerful, drawing upon a rich interdisciplinary and cross-cultural framework that considers Buddhist contemplative science, depth psychotherapy, health psychology research and interpersonal neurobiology.    As for practice, we will situate our experiential learning within the context of the role-modeling imagery of the Healing Mentor or Medicine Buddha (Bhaishajya-guru) and the seven-step mentor-bonding process that facilitates, corrects and expedites our natural evolutionary development into fully effective altruists. Course 5 assumes prior familiarization with key Buddhist concepts of causal activity (karma), altruistic intent (bodhicitta), and radical openness (shunyata), but is open to all with sincere motivation to heal and be healed. Our six-part series concludes with a daylong retreat on Saturday, November 1 exploring another celebrated mentor-archetype practice called the Healing Mother (Arya Tara). 
 Monday, October 20: 7-9PM

Each topic is explained and demonstrated concisely by attorney Johnson with referece to nearly 200 Powerpoint slides, humor and fun, and an official 66-page "The Whole Music Business" workbook.

Why should I attend a live workshop?  Isn’t there enough stuff on-line?  
  
That depends.  If you drift or lose focus watching on-line courses, get incomplete or inaccurate information, or if working from the vacuum of your bedroom leaves you uninspired and unfulfilled, get off your butt and attend my LIVE workshop.  Disrupt the inertia and see what comes your way.  If anything, sitting around dozens of other like-minded people will motivate you to work harder, and the people you meet from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania may become future friends and collaborators (who you’ve actually met and looked in the eye.)

Founded in 2004 by New York guitarist Steph Paynes, the group didn't take long to acquire a reputation for playing Zeppelin’s music with a kind of passion and force beyond anyone’s expectations, quickly attracting industry attention. In June 2005, Chuck Klosterman wrote an article for Spin magazine that featured Lez Zeppelin as a leading protagonist in a trend of all-female hard rock tribute bands. The fortunes and notoriety of the group surged, and Lez Zeppelin became a provocative subject for the news media across the world. 
In April 2007, after extensive touring in the US and Europe, Lez Zeppelin released its eponymous debut. In the wake of this release, the band was invited as the first tribute band to ever appear at a series of major rock festivals, including the Download Festival (formerly Donnington Park) in the UK, Rock-Am-Ring and Rock-Im-Park in Germany, and the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. However, it was an announcement in February of 2008 that Lez Zeppelin would take the stage at the Bonnaroo Festival that sparked a worldwide media storm. Throughout 2008, the group continued to tour heavily in the US and performed in Japan and India in support of its debut album. 
Following a three-month tour of the US, the band headed back into the studio to start on a second album, which would take the group back to where it all began - Led Zeppelin’s 1969 debut. Recording at Margouleff’s Pie Studios, a world-class analog facility, the band employed all of the same vintage equipment used by Led in 1968, working fastidiously to recreate the incredibly complex layers of the album. Having released the disc in 2010, and fresh off a worldwide tour supporting the release, Lez Zeppelin continues to deliver a musical experience that not only exceeds expectations, but serves as the authentic female counterpart to one of the greatest rock groups of all time.This monthly show at EastVille is a show you don't want to miss!

Running time is 50 minutes to 1 hour.Executives in the global ecosystem are faced with an environment of rapid change, different cultural values, volatile political and economic conditions, and increased government regulation.

You will learn how to enhance your effectiveness as a communicator as well as your ability to access “peak performance” states. 
You will learn about how you unconsciously and often unintentionally influence your thoughts, feelings and behaviors and those of others. By becoming aware of these “patterns of influence” you will have choices you never dreamed possible. 
NLP focuses on solutions, not problems. Instead of asking the questions, “How am I broken?” and “Why can’t I change?,” we ask questions like, “What do I want?” and “What inner resources will I need to get there?” 
Skills and techniques you will be learning include: 

Transforming the way you think using “submodalities”
Identifying and changing your limiting assumptions
Changing your perceptual positions
Accessing your inner resources
Developing greater rapport skills
Learning how to take a “step back” from unpleasant states
Learning how to access resourceful states
Identifying verbal and non verbal patterns of influence

FAQs 
  
Do I bring my baby to the group?   
Babies are welcome:) That being said, if you decide you'd rather leave your baby at home so you can take a break, that's okay too.  Do what works best for you each week.   
  
How accesible for strollers is the space? Are there any stairs? 
Our location is very mom friendly, no stairs or tight spaces to navigate. Feel free to bring your stroller, or if you are more comfortable with a baby carrier, that's okay too. Whatever works best for you and your baby.  
   
What if I have to miss a session?  
 Life happens (especially as a new mom!) Do what you can to make it each week, but know that the program is valuable even if you have to miss some sessions.  It's more about you getting six weeks of support (vs. six sessions.) Much of the support is what happens between the sessions.  One of the best parts?  Developing friendships with so many supportive moms. 
  
Do you prorate for missed sessions? 
 We don't prorate our support groups for missed sessions as it's really about getting 6 weeks of support, resources, and friendships (vs 6 sessions). The group's facilitator often does email follow-up between sessions so you can get clued in to what you missed. 
  
What Our Moms Are Saying:  Becoming a new mom was the most exhilarating, exhausting, and intense journey I'd ever experienced. What I found I needed most was a sense of community, which is what this group offers. Meeting up, learning from, and laughing with other new mothers helps turn an uncertain and potentially scary time into a shared adventure. Renee makes everyone comfortable, and is a reassuring and knowledgeable guide for new moms. - Ellie, mom to Ben  The New Mom's Support Group for babies is a fun and easy way to bond with other moms. The focus is really on the mom, which is so unique in the vast universe of mommy and me classes in NYC. Renee is an excellent facilitator, creating a comfortable, supportive atmosphere in which we were able to gain each other's perspectives and share in the wonderful world of new motherhood. New moms in NYC shouldn't miss the opportunity to be a part of one of these groups! - Hallie, mom to Ana  I enjoyed taking part in the support group. It is great to be with moms and their little ones born around the same time as my daughter Jools. We shared and learned a lot from each other, but the best thing is that we made friends! - Denise, mom to JoolsJoin us for the dynamic, multimedia event Chillida: Combing the Wind and flamenco performance.

Saturdays | 12:00 pm - 3:00 pmDale Radio, the basement talk show with a fictitious host, brings some of the finest comedians and cultural figures together for a slightly intoxicated conversation about the creative process. 
Hailed as a “warped Johnny Carson” and “brilliant” with a “voice like a shoulder squeeze,” Dale has been delighting crowds with his never-give-up-pursuit of modest stardom for more than a decade. The largely improvised, hour-long live podcast taping features music by Steve O’Reilly and plenty of hard candy and booze to make it feel like your favorite uncle landed a late night gig. Dale Radio recently played to a packed house at the 13th Annual SF Sketchfest and closed out the popular 2014 NYC Podfest. 
The character is the alter ego of James Bewley, who has appeared in Dale’s combed-over guise at venues across the country for the past twelve years. Bewley is a performer and writer whose work has been presented as part of the Soundtrack Series, Dead Darlings, Punch Up Your Life, PS122’s COIL Festival and Two for the Show. He is currently a Senior Program Officer at the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.Strawberry Fields is a look-a-like, sound-a-like Beatles tribute, dedicated to bringing you as close to a real Beatles concert as you can get. The tribute takes you on a Magical Mystery Tour beginning in 1964, complete with mop top hair, black suits with thin ties, and the first four albums of music. The next stop, 1967, features the psychedelic era of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album with all the costumes and jackets on the album cover. The last stop includes the White Album, Abbey Road, and of course Let It Be.

Ready to raise your first round of institutional capital? The Series A Venture Conference is the place to make it happen. This is not for start-ups, or companies raising a few hundred K in angel capital. All company attendees must have at least $750K in annual revenue run rate to attend this conference. 
  
The Soho Loft - The Voice of Capital Formation - and Victoria Global, an emerging force in the Corporate Communications, Investor Relations and Public Relations arena, with FundingPost join together to bring you this groundbreaking conference. 
  
  
Features: 
  
  
This full-day conference will focus specifically on what Venture Capitalists are looking for, when they like to invest, what metrics you should have prior to raising capital, the types of terms they generally put in front of a company, how it affects your current and earlier-stage investors, what milestones you are expected to achieve with that capital, and more. 
  
  
The Series A round is currently considered difficult to raise. Lots of companies raising angel capital, with limited sources for the next step (the series A crunch). If you are serious about raising a series A and taking your company to the next level, come meet, learn from and network with over 20 VCs who actively invest in series A companies.

You will learn how to enhance your effectiveness as a communicator as well as your ability to access “peak performance” states. 
You will learn about how you unconsciously and often unintentionally influence your thoughts, feelings and behaviors and those of others. By becoming aware of these “patterns of influence” you will have choices you never dreamed possible. 
NLP focuses on solutions, not problems. Instead of asking the questions, “How am I broken?” and “Why can’t I change?,” we ask questions like, “What do I want?” and “What inner resources will I need to get there?” 
Skills and techniques you will be learning include: 

Transforming the way you think using “submodalities”
Identifying and changing your limiting assumptions
Changing your perceptual positions
Accessing your inner resources
Developing greater rapport skills
Learning how to take a “step back” from unpleasant states
Learning how to access resourceful states
Identifying verbal and non verbal patterns of influence

  Exposing the Psychotherapy/Psychoanalysis Binary: The Surprising Relevance of Racism, anti-Semitism, Misogyny, and Homophobia 
 Presented by: Karen Starr, Psy.D. 
  
How did psychoanalysis come to define itself as different from psychotherapy? How have racism, homophobia, misogyny, and anti-Semitism converged in the creation of psychotherapy and psychoanalysis? 
 This workshop examines the cultural biases and problematic binaries in which psychoanalysis has historically been caught. Drawing from her book with Lewis Aron, A Psychotherapy for the People: Toward a Progressive Psychoanalysis, Karen Starr traces the reverberations of racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and homophobia in the creation of psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis, associated with phallic masculinity, penetration, heterosexuality, autonomy, and culture, was defined in opposition to suggestion and psychotherapy, which were seen as promoting dependence, feminine passivity, and relationality. Deconstructing these dichotomies and gaining deeper insight into the cultural context within which psychoanalysis developed, can lead the way for a return to Freud’s progressive vision, in which psychoanalysis, defined broadly and flexibly, is revitalized for a new era, a true “psychotherapy for the people." 
  
Karen Starr, Psy.D. is Clinical Supervisor at The Graduate Center, City University of New York and Adjunct Faculty at Long Island University/C.W. Post. She is author and editor of several books and articles on psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, and Jewish Studies, including A Psychotherapy for the People: Toward a Progressive Psychoanalysis, with Lewis Aron; Relational Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy Integration, with Jill Bresler; and Repair of the Soul: Metaphors of Transformation in Jewish Mysticism and Psychoanalysis. Dr. Starr is on the Editorial Board of the Psychoanalysis and Jewish Life Book Series, Academic Press. She is an advanced candidate at the NYU Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis, and maintains a private practice in New York City and Great Neck, Long Island.Join us for an open house to discuss our Middle Project Freedom School, which will begin its inaugural monthly program this October.

Matt & Ben

Between 8th & 9th Avenues 
New York, New York 10036 
  
It's no surprise that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck became stars after the success of Good Will Hunting. The real shocker is that they actually wrote the critically-acclaimed screenplay. The Office's Mindy Kaling and actress Brenda Withers, skeptical of this claim, created this hilarious comedy that explains the "true" origin of the Academy Award-winning screenplay. This affectionate riff on the legendary bromance imagines the screenplay for Good Will Hunting mysteriously dropping from the sky, which causes the boys to believe that they're being tested by a higher power. 
  
Matt & Ben depicts its Hollywood golden boys - before J-Lo, before Gwyneth, before "Project Greenlight," before Oscar...before anyone actually gave a damn. When the screenplay for Good Will Hunting drops mysteriously from the heavens, the boys realize they're being tested by a Higher Power.  The play is written by both Brenda Withers as well as Mindy Kaling star of "The Office" on NBC and Fox's "The Mindy Project". 
  
This production is 70 minutes in length with no intermission.  There is no late seating.  Please be aware that the theater is located in the historic Producers Club's 2nd floor and that there is no elevator available.This three hour tour is a great way to explore three of Gotham's most historic locations. This tour meets at the East Broadway F train station, and takes you through legendary Lower East Side streets like Essex, Grand, Hester, Orchard, and Delancey. Along the way, we'll get a feel for what life was like for the millions of immigrants who arrived here throughout the 19th and early part of the 20th Century. We'll also see how this neighborhood has transformed into one of the hippest and trendiest areas in the city. 
From there, we'll discover NoLita(North of Little Italy), a charming area that is home to Lombardi's, NYC's first pizza place. This neighborhood features great Italian food, cool bars, former gangster haunts, as well as landmarks like Old St.Patrick's Cathedral (where the Baptism scene in the Godfather was filmed!) and the 14th Ward Industrial School. 
Nolita is also the birthplace of legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese. The last part of the tour has us going through the East Village. We'll hit the Bowery, a 400 year old thru-fare that has undergone a radical transformation in the past 30 years. What was once a rough and tumble street known to be the underbelly of NYC, the Bowery now features swanky hotels and upscale boutiques and bars. We'll pass by the exact spot where the famous punk rock club CBGB once stood. We'll also see the Hell's Angels Headquarters, Cooper Union, St. Mark's Place, and much more.  
Some of the sites we will see on the Lower East Side, Nolita and East Village Tour: 

The Jewish Daily Forward building
Seward Park Library
Hester, Grand and Delancey Street
Orchard Street
The Pickle Guys
Old St. Patrick's
Lombardi's Pizza
The Bowery
Bowery Mural
Original CBGB location
Joey Ramone Place
Amato Opera House

Cooper Union
Former Village Voice headquarters

Whether you are just starting up or expanding an existing business, this course will help you learn about credit and financing opportunities for your small business. Additionally, the course will give insight on what lenders are looking for in the current credit environment so you can be best prepared when applying for financing. Total course hours: 1 session, varies by Center from 1.5-2 hours. 
You will learn about: 

What type of financing product and lender is the best fit for your business
What steps are involved in the process of obtaining financing
What to consider when preparing a financing application
How lenders will evaluate your application
How you can best meet the requirements for today’s lenders
What additional resources exist for understanding and improving your credit historyThis immersive, forty-hour training program contains a set of three comprehensive courses that provides the knowledge and skill to become a successful Scrum developer and a valuable member of a Scrum development team. 
In our first course, Scrum Framework Developer Essentials, we'll explore the Scrum Framework and how it supports faster and simpler software development. In Design Pattern Developer Essentials, we'll discover a core set of design patterns that every developer should know. The program concludes with the popular Scrum Software Developer Essentials course, in which you’ll learn how to write higher quality code more quickly and with fewer defects using the practices from Extreme Programming (XP) that include test-first development, refactoring, and emergent design, as well as a variety of Agile problem-solving techniques. 
You’ll be taken on a guided tour through essential developer practices such as story writing, sprint planning, pair programming, and test driven development. You’ll learn how to discover patterns in problems and to implement designs as needed. We’ll also explore the principles behind the practices so you understand how to use them to make the best design choices, and you’ll gain a powerful framework for encapsulating and abstracting virtually any problem for maximum flexibility, without over complicating the solution. 
By exploring the secrets of high-performance, cross-functional development teams you'll gain a shared design vocabulary for dramatically improving inter-team communication that can be applied equally well to new development and to maintaining or extending existing systems. Then we'll put theory into practice and apply your new skills by building the core of an application using the expert-level techniques you’ve learned for rapidly writing quality software. 
By the end of this training program you’ll be armed with several new, effective tools and techniques for Scrum development that will make your software more robust, manageable, and easier to extend.

Why should I attend a live workshop?  Isn’t there enough stuff on-line?  
  
That depends.  If you drift or lose focus watching on-line courses, get incomplete or inaccurate information, or if working from the vacuum of your bedroom leaves you uninspired and unfulfilled, get off your butt and attend my LIVE workshop.  Disrupt the inertia and see what comes your way.  If anything, sitting around dozens of other like-minded people will motivate you to work harder, and the people you meet from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania may become future friends and collaborators (who you’ve actually met and looked in the eye.)  
  
Here’s a summary of what’s in store:  
  
10:00 am  Copyright law and music publishing 
  
11:15   Recording and radio industry / Band names and trademark law

Fall 2014 is the beginning of the shmita (Sabbatical) year, when according to biblical law the land of Israel must lie fallow. Shmita comes to remind us that the earth does not belong to us; we are merely its stewards. It is incumbent upon us to treat the earth with care, reverence, and humility. If we honor those practices and translate them into the ways we live our lives and interact with those at the margins, we could truly transform our community. 
The JCC in Manhattan is excited to partner with the greenhouse of Ein Shemer, one of Israel’s most innovative ecological learning grounds, created by renowned artist Avital Geva. This multimedia exhibit introduces Ein Shemer and its mission to the community through ecological art and sculpture and images by renowned photographer Frédéric Brenner. The project is multifaceted and multidisciplinary and will allow our community an opportunity to learn about Israel through the lens of science, ecology, and the arts.Invensis Learning is conducting 2-day full-time TUV-SUD Accredited Cloud Computing Certification Training in New York City, NY, US along with Cloud Computing Examination on the 2nd day of the training.

Embodying Your Spiritual Family Tree:  Heart Teachings on the Path to Bliss-Void Integration 
  
This four-part Nalanda Institute seminar introduces the art of spiritual re-parenting in the Nalanda tradition, considered by all Tibetan schools the most effective way of ripening our minds and nervous systems for blissful, altruistic engagement with all life and the earth we share.  By consciously upgrading our traumatic development with heroic imagery and affirmation, safe in the healing circle of a spiritual mentor family and community, this art catalyzes the alchemical rewiring we need to embody a blissfully integrated open self and world. We first unpack this art as the unexcelled vehicle for traveling the gradual path to blissful openness, the living-breathing womb in which we can naturally develop all four limbs we need for that path: mindful well-being, altruistic openness, healing vision, and sublime passion. We then explore its universal human logic and depth-psychological method, both in terms of Buddhist contemplative science and in terms of modern neuropsychology. Our journey is based on the heart teachings of the Ganden-Kagyu tradition of Tibet, as distilled in the masterful, all-encompassing practice of Mentor Devotion, by the first Panchen Lama, Losang Chokyi Gyaltsan. We also flesh out this practice with the spiritual biography of Tibet’s first home-grown Master Altruist, the beloved cotton-clad yogi Milarepa.

Making Markets Work  
for Development 
  
Interview with  
Eduardo Pérez Motta 
  
The Antitrust in Emerging and Developing Country conference will be held on October 24, 2014 at New York University, School of Law. André Marques Gilberto – Campos Mellos Advogados, Saõ Paulo – has interviewed Eduardo Pérez Motta – former President, Federal Competition Commission, Mexico, now Partner at AGON, Mexico City.  André Marques Gilberto will participate in the panel discussion: "Making Markets Work for Development".  Other panel speakers include: Tania Begazo Gomez – World Bank – Dennis Davis – South African Competition Appeal Court – R. Shyam Khemani – former World Bank – and Professor Ian MCEwin – University of Malaya.  Professor Eleanor Fox will moderate the panel. 
  
André Marques Gilberto: In addition to typical market failures – natural monopoly, externalities, asymmetric information etc. – what are the most relevant limits to competition in your jurisdiction (e.g. bureaucracy within the competition agency, protectionist measures seasonally implemented by the Federal Government, pressure from lobbyists etc.)? 
  
Eduardo Pérez Motta: Restrictions to competition in Mexico come mainly from an anticompetitive regulatory framework. This is especially important in sectors that are naturally regulated sectors like: Telecoms, Energy, Transport and Financial Services. All those sectors are network activities where efficiency depends on the size of network services offered. They all represent the basic platform of productivity in any economy.  
  
André Marques Gilberto: What would be examples of recent actions taken by your Federal Government to establish a more competitive framework? 
  
Eduardo Pérez Motta: The most comprehensive set of actions taken by the Federal Government and the main political parties in the Mexican Congress are the major Constitutional regulatory reforms that started last year. All of them have the main purpose is to inject efficiency, through competition, in the education, telecoms, financial services and energy market. 
  
André Marques Gilberto: What is the importance of the connection between competition law and trade policies in terms of fostering competition in your jurisdiction? 
  
Eduardo Pérez Motta: The connection in these two policies is relevant. In the Mexican case the main introduction of competition in Mexican markets started with the opening of the economy through multilateral trade liberalization initially and then a global network of bilateral negotiation with Mexico’s main trading partners. Decisions that have taken place in 2013/2014 complement, through domestic procompetitive regulatory reforms in non-tradable service´s sectors, the competition pressure that has taken place in most tradable manufacturing activities.

So if you are a fan and enjoy the sounds of these Rock and Roll Hall of Famers, who are still performing World Wide today, you should make it a must to go and see Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, along with a sure thing "THE JERSEY FOUR"!Big Shot returns to B.B. King Blues Club and is fronted by the amazing vocals of singer-songwriter and piano man Michael DelGuidice. DelGuidice is a well-known and respected Long Island musician and multi-instrumentalist. With vocals that stand out above all others, he recently released a 10-song album of his own material, titled Miller Place (2010). His tribute band Big Shot is truly a national-level act, featuring all world-class musicians who have not only toured with Billy Joel but have also worked with names like Michael Bolton, Hall & Oates, Huey Lewis, Diana Ross, Billy Joel's Broadway Musical, Richie Blackmore, Tower of Power, Nine Days, and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. 
Big Shot's performance is a 90-minute to two-hour show not to be believed, packed with hit after chart-topping hit in a high energy, interactive stage performance. The show almost exclusively covers Billy Joel's music, but the band will also surprise you with songs by Elton John, The Beatles, Journey, Paul McCartney, Marc Cohn, and many others. 
Don't miss these special guests performing with the band about which Billy Joel himself declared: "They had a hard time convincing me it wasn't me. It's uncanny."On the Hook™ Ups:  A Live, Monthly Event in NYC

Did you know that trauma shapes who we become? 
Did you know that trauma stands between who we are and who we could be? 
If you don’t understand trauma and learn how to help your clients heal, your clients won’t reach their true potential. 
Imagine feeling competent and confident dealing with your clients’ deepest blockages and having the tools to help them? 
Imagine the healing you could bring to the world?

Bye for now, 
ValerieOver the past few years, some of the most innovative brands have been done in by privacy and safety issues. With more regulation on the horizon plus global scrutiny over freemium models, it’s a complicated time to be in the gaming business. 
How do you continue to innovate, pushing the boundaries of creativity and user engagement while steering clear of scrutiny? How do you keep investors and regulators happy? How do you create connected experiences but keep teens safe? What are some of the best practices for building business models for products that appeal to young consumers?  
This event demystifies privacy rules, explains the top safety considerations for your website or app, and discusses norms around business models for young consumers. You’ll leave knowing how we got here, practical steps towards compliance that don’t compromise creativity, and how to get ready for what’s coming next.NB.
