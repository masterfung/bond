This company learned the secrets on how to market and promote their company to the health sciences industry. Jared will give you his story of how his company added healthcare as another line of business for them and how they succeeded and continue to succeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Logistics&lt;/b&gt;: Refreshments are provided for all our early birds!

-118.398811Improve PUBLIC SPEAKING SKILLS with Toastmasters &quot;Speakers by the Sea&quot; Club
http://www.meetup.com/TOASTMASTERS-Speakers-by-the-Sea-Club/events/196683862/
&lt;p&gt;Meetings begin at 11am (prompt) every Wednesday; end at 12pm. Visitors are always welcome!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Toastmasters is a non-profit organization started in 1924 to help people improve their skills for speaking in public. Membership in Toastmasters is inexpensive and is one of the greatest investments you can make in yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;strong style=&quot;font-size : medium&quot;&amp;gt;How Does It Work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooqVQlGB8I&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooqVQlGB8I&quot; class=&quot;embedded&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NooqVQlGB8I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ToastmastersSpeakersByTheSea&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/ToastmastersSpeakersByTheSea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Toastmasters meeting is a learn-by-doing workshop in which participants hone their speaking and leadership skills in a no-pressure atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no instructor in a Toastmasters meeting. Instead, members evaluate one another’s presentations. This feedback process is a key part of the program’s success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meeting participants also give impromptu talks on assigned topics, conduct meetings and develop skills related to timekeeping, grammar and parliamentary procedure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google maps/yahoo maps/mapquest etc can be misleading.  We meet 1 light S. of Imperial Highway on Vista del Mar - Turn into the Facility off of Vista del Mar at Hyperion Way.  We meet in a nice conference room on the 2nd Floor, #230A.  Photo ID is required at the facility entrance.  Arrive by 10:50am as the meetings start on time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will share what we are going through with people who understand. We can share a tasty treat and an empathetic ear.... maybe even a gentle hug. :o) I think that if we have a place where we can share what we are going through regularly it will make dealing with this and other chronic conditions a little easier. If the group is larger than 6 people we will have to either rent the back room for $5 an hour or find another place to meet... I&#39;m open to suggestions. :o)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing you. :o) Gentle Hugs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello! I realized that there are many movie adventures out there that I would hate for you all to miss out on just because I may not be there to join you! So I&#39;ve decided I should present you with the opportunity anyways! Fun fact, I used to work at this very library, and so the movie day holds a special place in my heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;


****THERE IS NO HOST FOR THIS EVENT****&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;


This is a free community event offered by the Library and is subject to be cancelled/rescheduled at the Library&#39;s discretion.&lt;br/&gt;The library shows a free movie most Wednesdays at 1pm.

&lt;p&gt;i think i&#39;ll start by doing a weekly meetup.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;this time around, i chose a wednesday and switched the time to 4pm, but i&#39;ll consider the time slot unofficial until a bit of trial and error and continually getting feedback from you guys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;i&#39;ll make the first main topic of discussion the book &quot;unconditional parenting&quot; by alfie kohn.  i&#39;ll bring the book (well, it&#39;s on my kindle).  though you are very much encouraged to bring your own topics of discussion to the table.  this is just a starting place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;feel free to bring food and drink &amp;amp; maybe a blanket to sit on, and it can be a sort of picnic-style get-together.  these may be a bit sporadic at first, so check the discussion tab (or send me a message) for the latest info on that.&lt;/p&gt;

http://www.meetup.com/AdventurePeople/events/196654162/
&lt;p&gt;Charles brings 2-4 balls and 2 court boundary lines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Total beginners to advanced players are welcome to join us for a fun competitive workout. Your welcome to bring friends - just mark them down as guests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DONATIONS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We need to replace my volleyballs and need 2-3 more court boundaries.  The organizer for Adventure People have given this space beach volleyball meetups don&#39;t welcome. To post meetups on other meetup groups requires 3 people post a meeting suggestion and agree to meet for events to be sent to all members. The other alternative is to collect dues to pay $150 a year or $75 twice a year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FREEWAY EXIT FOR COURTS:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the Santa Monica #10 Freeway heading west, take the 4th &amp;amp; 5th offramp.&lt;br/&gt;Stay left for the 4th street offramp. (Right is 5th Ave offramp.)&lt;br/&gt;I take the center lane to turn Left on 4th.&lt;br/&gt;Right on Pico and keep going &amp;amp; turn left at Ocean Ave (at an angle). Some park on the street near Hollister Ave. for $2.00 each hour. But don&#39;t pay for parking after 6 PM when parking is free.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There may be free parking on the other side of Main Street, 2 blocks East of Ocean Ave., in the a residential area. But if you park there make sure parking is permitted before restrictions set in. A ticket may cost $50 or more if not careful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Residential parking between Ocean Ave &amp;amp; Main Street is restricted to residents only.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TWO HOUR PARKING LOT&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I understand after sundown parking gets citations at any 2 hours lots including the pier. (With the pier open till 2 AM that is surprising.) Many park in 2 hour lots for 2 hours and some return to pay for more parking. Parking in 2 hour lot is $1.00 per hour. After 6 PM parking on the street at meters is free. And 2 hour lot meter does not accept money for time after around 6 PM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALL DAY PARKING LOT&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believe all day parking is $8.00 weekdays Summer Rate.&lt;br/&gt;All day parking may save getting a $53.00 ticket. If you park at Santa Monica beach parking lots often they sell monthly pass. I believe the woman said they sell monthly passes for $27.00 for a month but that sounds low. A six month pass costs $87 for all day parking lots at any Santa Monica beach including parking not far from Will Rogers. If lot is closed they let cars with a pass in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I&#39;ve seen a ticket person drive away and not cite me after sundown and 8PM when all day lot is closed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HOW TO FIND ME&lt;br/&gt;Cell is [masked] if you have trouble finding us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SUGGESTIONS TO WEAR/BRING&lt;br/&gt;Suggest wearing swiming clothes to not overheat playing even in cold winter months. But bring a t-shirt, tank top &amp;amp; sweat top/bottom &amp;amp; medium weight coat to stay warm if wind blows to not be cold. Wind sometimes speeds up after 11 AM to 1 PM can be cold between games.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I recommend bringing a bag or small pack with more clothing layers if it cools down or gets cold. My pack includes: something to drink, suntan lotion, sunglasses, hat, ball pump, etc. The bag is always ready to go to not hunt around home for things sometimes needed to be able to grab and go without thinking or remembering anything extra. I have Bags for badminton, tennis and sailing to always be ready to go also.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most days Malibu to Palos Verdes are visible. Is your gym free with such a spectacular view?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It only takes about 10 minutes to warm up on most Winter cold mornings-so a beach workout year round is possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DOUBLES TOURNAMENTS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some may enjoy doubles tournaments but few offer man &amp;amp; women teams. Do any players want co-ed doubles and man/man &amp;amp; woman/woman teams to add to fun?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CO-HOSTS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I cannot host a meetup it will be nice to have one or two hosts that can bring boundaries and balls. Any volunteers? This should be a rare event.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Charles&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER, WARNING OF RISK ETC: YOU AGREE BY GOING ON THIS EVENT THAT YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY AND THAT THE MEETUP ORGANIZERS HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR SAFETY.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/d/d/c/4/event_251516772.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year marks the fifth anniversary of this worthy event.  It&#39;s an opportunity to give back to the community while enjoying happy hour with friends and others who share the same feelings about educating today&#39;s children as you do. The support over the last four years has been phenomenal, for which we are truly grateful.  However, many schools are still in a situation where basic supplies go unfunded and most of the families whose children attend these schools are unable to supply the shortfall.  Many teachers pay for basic school supplies out of their own pocket, but it&#39;s not enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cocktails for Crayons has helped fill the gap for one particularly needy OC elementary school.  This happy hour event is a chance to donate much needed supplies and have fun doing so.  Just pick up any basic school supplies from one of the many retail stores around Orange County and bring them with you.  Too busy to shop? Gift cards to Staples &amp;amp; Target are great ways to contribute. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**&lt;b&gt;EXCITING NEWS&lt;/b&gt;! A representative from Staples will be at the event to sell gift cards to anyone who didn&#39;t have the opportunity to shop beforehand!! Thanks for the support Staples!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Below is the teachers wishlist:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;paper, pencils, large glue sticks (1.75 ounce ), large &amp;amp; small paper clips, colored pencils, copy paper, crayons (24 crayons in a box), Liquid Paper, construction paper, pens, dry erase markers &amp;amp; erasers, stickers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The event takes place in the Sapphire Lounge inside the Radisson Hotel-Newport Beach (ENTRANCE IS ON BIRCH STREET).  There will be &lt;b&gt;HALF OFF&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;APPETIZERS&lt;/b&gt; and a chance to meet some dedicated and passionate people about educating the youth of today to be the leaders of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There will also be a &lt;b&gt;RAFFLE&lt;/b&gt; to all those who donate!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year was a HUGE success with over 100 people in attendance and we are expecting an even bigger turn out this year!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AS OF JULY 29, THERE ARE OVER 80 PEOPLE ATTENDING!!!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This event is cross posted with other meetup groups and Facebook! :)&lt;/p&gt;

http://www.meetup.com/snailsbrea-chapter/events/199275962/
&lt;p&gt;Track work out using Yasso 800s. Start with 5 800 Yassos and then add 1 Yasso 800 each week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where to park - PARK ON THE STREET ALONG WILDCAT WAY, THEN WALK THE DRIVE WAY LEADING TO THE TRACK.  Call my (Jimmy) mobile if you are lost [masked]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is a Yasso 800?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yasso 800s are a popular workout among runners who are trying to achieve a specific marathon goal. The name &quot;Yasso&quot; comes from Bart Yasso, the chief running officer at Runner&#39;s World magazine, who popularized this workout. Here&#39;s how to do Yasso 800s:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;•Take your marathon goal time in hours/minutes and convert this to minutes/seconds. For example, if your marathon goal is 3 hours and 45 minutes then convert that to 3 minutes and 45 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;•Try to run 800 meters (approximately 1/2 mile) in your converted time (3:45 in this example).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;•Recover after each 800 by jogging or walking for the same amount of time (again, 3:45 in this example)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Come join the fun&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By joining the meetup, you agree to the Meetup Terms of Service, which release the ASPRC and the Organizers from any liability related to incidents that occur at Meetup gatherings&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; YOU acknowledge that WE ARE NOT PROFESSIONALS.  &amp;gt; YOU ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR SAFETY&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

Running is a rewarding and pleasant activity, but there are certain dangers you should be aware of. Those include, but are not limited to injuries due to twists, trips and falls on the roads, curbs and sidewalks, dangers from traffic on the roads, dogs and bugs, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By signing up for this event, you agree to hold harmless the ASPRC, the organizer(s) and other participants for any injuries sustained during this run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello friends!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s time for a beach meetup! Let&#39;s meet on Wednesday evening, the beach is a lot less crowded during the week and most of the dogs there are regulars. We will meet at the south end of Huntington Dog Beach and then possibly move north a little bit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are two parking lots between Seapoint and Goldenwest that service Huntington Dog Beach. These parking lots now feature electronic parking meters that print out parking passes for your dashboard. The cost is $1.50 per hour. These machines take Visa/MC, currency, and coins. Additionally, there is metered parking along PCH at the Goldenwest end of Dog Beach. I always park in the residential neighborhood at PCH/Goldenwest and just walk across the street to the beach. If you drive about a block into the neighborhood there is free non metered parking (the first block is metered parking).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I recommend bringing a towel for your Boston if they are anything like Lola &amp;amp; Violet they will be covered in sand when you leave. I have seen some people bring a jug of water to rinse their dog off too. I always bring a bottle of water and a portable bowl in case my girls gets thirsty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hope to see you all there!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lita, Lola and Violet too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you&#39;re having a tough time creating a believable hero or villain? Or maybe you need help wording that riveting dilemma for your protagonist to overcome? Or if it&#39;s just another creative mind off of which to bounce ideas that you&#39;re looking for, this meet-up is for you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Come join us for this weekly meet-up and spend the evening writing! After initial intros we can go into discussing hints and tips on writing followed immediately by intermittent writing spurts: 20-minute writing bouts interspersed with 5-minute breaks. Yes, this session will rely heavily on our handy little TIMER!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bring a pen and some paper or a laptop if you&#39;re more digitally inclined! I&#39;m just uncertain of the ability to plug into any outlets, so be forewarned!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We look forward to seeing you there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really liked it here, so let&#39;s do it again!  Plenty of seating, great bartenders, and charming atmosphere. Happy hour specials on drinks and food, until 7:00! Oh, and there was plenty of street parking, which is meter free after 6PM! (*at least where I parked across the street it was.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m setting the time for 6:00, for those that can get there early and want to get in on the the happy hour specials. Showing up at 7:00 is fine, too! Please change your RSVP if you decide that you cannot attend. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have paid yearly dues, you do not pay for this event. If you have not, then the dues for this meetup event is $1. &lt;i&gt;Please pay online when you RSVP&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yearly dues can be paid by credit card, by clicking on the &#39;Member Dues&#39; link on our group page. Dues help offset the yearly organizer fees that Meetup.com charges. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join Southern California&#39;s best Wednesday night hike! We proudly boast over 6 years of a traditional Wednesday night hike up to Echo Mountain missing only a few days when circumstances would not permit a safe and pleasant hike. Many people have ventured up to join the &quot;Happy Hour potluck&quot; from this Meetup and from Early Bird Hiking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/9/4/600_286085012.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please R.S.V.P if you believe you will be joining this hike and post what time you are planning to start - it encourages others to join. Seeing as &lt;b&gt;we do not meet as a group at the beginning of the hike&lt;/b&gt; - it is best to try to find others who can hike up at the same time so no one hikes alone. Hikers usually head back down in two or three different groups anywhere between about 8 and 9PM(some a little earlier). &lt;b&gt;First Timers - Please read the &quot;First Timers&quot; section, CAREFULLY !&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

Around the turn of the century things were a little different on Echo Mountain and Mt. Lowe:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc_lqdHyNNs&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc_lqdHyNNs&quot; class=&quot;embedded&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc_lqdHyNNs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no trash collection at the top of Echo Mountain. Please help to keep the area clean by taking some down - there are trash bins at the gate. It is not fair to burden the last hikers to leave the top with all the trash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Newcomers&lt;/b&gt; - please read &quot;First Timers&quot; and &quot;What to bring&quot; sections below so you don&#39;t wind up on the wrong trail or be left in the dark. We do not gather and hike up as a group due to different hiking abilities and arrival times. Many people post their anticipated start time making it easy to form smaller groups for the trip up. You can use this website to communicate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Sun will set at &lt;b&gt;7:42PM&lt;/b&gt; with about another 25 minutes of twilight. (The days are getting shorter!) Hikers go up at different times, depending on when they can get to the trailhead. There will be 87% of the Moon rising tonight, but it will not be rising until 9:44PM. Evening temperatures can sometimes get a little cool, even at this time of year - many folks bring a dry top to change into for comfort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Hike&lt;/b&gt;: We follow the (lower)Sam Merrill Trail up the East wall of Las Flores Canyon to Echo Mountain and ruins of the former White City. This is a moderate hike of about &lt;b&gt;2.6 miles up&lt;/b&gt; with about a &lt;b&gt;1400 ft. elevation&lt;/b&gt; gain and &lt;b&gt;2.6 miles down&lt;/b&gt; on a very well maintained trail. &lt;b&gt;This is not a hike for beginners.&lt;/b&gt; We do this hike every week weather permitting and it just keeps getting better. People start out at different times between about 5:30 and 6:30 (some even start earlier). Average time up is about 1 hour to 1-1/4 hours (slower hikers may take 90 minutes - almost everyone makes it back down in about an hour)This is a &quot;go at your own pace hike&quot; so almost anyone with some hiking experience can make it. Post your anticipated time to start - this gives people the opportunity to form groups to hike up together. Most people bring up something to share such as a bottle of wine, cheese, deli meats, fruit, beer, etc. etc. You couldn&#39;t meet a nicer group of people, so if its friends that you are looking for, this hike is it! The warm, friendly party atmosphere at the top has become a highlight to a lot of our work weeks, so if you are into great company, food, drinks, historic hotel ruins and fantastic views than come on up, you will love it.!!!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;First timers&lt;/b&gt;: You may locate the trailhead on Google Maps by entering &lt;b&gt;3388 Lake Ave. Altadena, Ca. 91001&lt;/b&gt;. If you are not hiking with someone who is familiar with the trail, please read this carefully. As you reach the top of the paved road where it turns, &lt;b&gt;DO NOT TURN&lt;/b&gt; - there is a sign that says &quot;Trail&quot; with an arrow pointing to the right - follow this and &lt;b&gt;you will pass a water fountain on your left&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Continue to the edge of the canyon&lt;/b&gt; and take the trail to the left - DO NOT descend into the canyon here - follow the trail around the edge of the canyon, descending behind the debris dam and up the far side following the trail to the left. As you ascend, you want to be able to look across Los Flores Canyon towards where the sun set (or is setting). You are about 1/2 way as you pass under the power towers. When you reach the junction after about 2.5 miles, go to the right - slightly downhill a few hundred feet to the Echo Mountain House ruins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to bring&lt;/b&gt;: Out of concern for the environment, please bring a reusable cup or non-breakable glass for your beverage, good hiking shoes, water, maybe a wind breaker or similar(some folks bring something dry to change into) - it is best to layer. Also, something to share for the pot luck, and a HEADLIGHT OR FLASHLIGHT for  the hike down, even when there is moonlight, there are areas of the trail that are in the shadows. In windy conditions, we gather at the &quot;picnic grounds&quot; on the left side of the trail just before the Echo Mountain House ruins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;: Take the I-210 towards Pasadena, get off on Lake Ave., go North until Lake Ave. ends. On the right side where it ends is the gate to the former Cobb Estate and the road leading to the trail head. The best parking is when you turn left at the end of Lake onto Loma Alta Dr. Park on Loma Alta as the unrestricted parking is to 10 PM You will get a ticket on Lake parking is only until 8pm. Parking off Loma Alta on Monterosa or Marengo is unrestricted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Post what time you&#39;d like to go up and form your own groups.

For those who weren&#39;t with us last year, the Sunset Power Hour is a workout made fun, but a workout none the less! Modeled after our SUP FUSION X workout, it incorporates paddling technique exercises, soccer-type team drills, and a bundle of other goodies that we created to make anybody a stronger and more efficient paddler. Don&#39;t be scared though! FUN is still our priority!! You don&#39;t have to be a good paddler or have ever even paddled before to come out and join us. You just have to be willing to hustle and be a team player. The Sunset Power Hour is the most fun workout you&#39;ll ever experience and we always finish up the workout by gathering the pack and watching the sun set over the sea before heading back to land. These sessions will be $25.00 a person and will require an advance reservation no later than &amp;lt;a&amp;gt;2pm on Wednesday afternoon&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. We will be requiring a minimum of 6 reservations to host each session so tell your peeps!! We only got room for 14 of ya so be sure and book your spot early!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

WED Night from 6:00- 8:00pm.&lt;br/&gt;Class is $25 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Class includes board, paddle and life jacket rental.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have your own board join us and class is only $15 dollars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Olympus SUPfit POWER HOUR is approx 1.5-2 hour (with 30 mins for with on and off water loading/unloading time).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For this class session above we launch from the small hand launching dock located behind Rubys Diner and the Seaside Lagoon.

BT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, August 13, Gary Johnston will present “The 5 Keys to Financial Freedom” Gary has been an active investor in real estate and notes for over 25 years. He was with Hewlett-Packard for 16 years as director of research and development in the LaserJet business unit before leaving the rat race at age 38. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of Gary&#39;s early mentors, Norbert Volny, taught him that no one gets rich on a W-2; you have to make your money work harder than you do. Gary will share tools and strategies to build lasting wealth and obtain financial freedom. Learn about structuring deals to increase cash flow today and secure benefits in the future. Given the current market, it is more important than ever to understand and apply these principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will also learn about the single most powerful financial tool any investor can own.  Gary refers to it as the crystal ball because it really can tell your future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t miss Gary’s presentation!  Take it from a recent attendee, who said, “On several occasions I found myself saying, ‘That piece of information alone was worth the price of the class.’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“After attending your class, I’ve added it to the ‘must take’ list of classes I recommend to beginners as well as seasoned pros. Everyone in this business needs the info you share. A real eye-opener ─ three days extremely well spent.”                     ─ Mike Cantu&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Unbelievable information. Clear step by step education building upon concepts to best absorb difficult concepts.&quot;  – Karen M.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I wish that I’d taken this class prior to spending $10,000-plus on investment classes taught by other ‘gurus’ – I’d have done things much differently and would have more money to invest. The good news: I’ll now implement a few good ideas and expect better results.”  ─ Trish Jones&lt;/p&gt;

It&#39;s approximately 3 1/2 miles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll meet on Oxnard Street, 200 feet west from the northwest corner, and start from there. Bring a bottle of water—the days are getting warmer!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please RSVP that you will be coming. We will wait until 6:05 p.m. and then we&#39;ll leave. Try to avoid driving Victory Blvd. That street is really crowded. There is plenty of parking along Oxnard St. west of Winnetka.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All ages welcome!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See you then!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

http://www.meetup.com/Woodland-Hills-Walking-and-Hiking/events/196898002/
&lt;p&gt;This week, we&#39;ll walk over to Pierce College and hike up on the cross country trails. Now that the days are longer it&#39;s light enough to go up on the hill! It&#39;s approximately 3 1/2 miles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll meet on Oxnard Street, 200 feet west from the northwest corner, and start from there. Bring a bottle of water—the days are getting warmer!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please RSVP that you will be coming. We will wait until 6:05 p.m. and then we&#39;ll leave.

http://www.meetup.com/Dog-Training-Hiking-Adventures/events/194091662/
&lt;p&gt;Professional Dog Trainer Kurt Burk will lead a group of dogs and their owners on a hike each Wednesday around sunset for about 90 mins. Dog owners can ask dog training questions and socialize their dogs. Over time, dogs will look forward to seeing their friends and get great exercise at the same time. This week we are meeting at 6:15 pm and will start the hike at 6:30 pm sharp. If you have any questions or are late text Kurt at [masked]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NOTE: This is a Moderate-High level hike, so expect a workout! Our group tends to move quickly and likes to challenge ourselves and our dogs physically on new trails. Kurt will help you learn to handle your dog on trails by showing you how to keep your dog behind you as you descend trails. If you can&#39;t keep up, just take your time or back track. If you are a beginner hiker, bring a friend so you aren&#39;t alone on the trail if you can&#39;t keep up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Text Kurt ahead of time with any questions or concerns.

&lt;p&gt;TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• What is the big picture?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• What is the full human potential?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• How important is the earth? And who wants it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Our DNA. 10 strands that have been dormant are coming alive. To join the double helix that is already active. 12 in total. To align with our 12 chakras&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• We are changing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• What is the control system in place?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Why this control system can never touch who we really are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Who is helping us outside of this planet?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;• Who is not helping us outside of this planet? Meaning who is here for themselves using humans?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• The power of presence&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;



We will first discuss the big picture and the items above.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then we will introduce ourselves and come to awareness of our own roles here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Participation is not mandatory. Feel free to come and listen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donation is not mandatory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you like the talk, suggested donation is $10  to help keep it going. Either that, or a plate of raw food is very welcomed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I hope to see you soon my fellow brother and sister.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;



Thank you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quin&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;



UPDATED VIDEO: The following video helped put a lot of the pieces together for me. Staret viewing video from time slot 23 minutes. And 40 seconds. I hope it helps for you too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

About me&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ever since little being in a physical body as always been awkward for me. Now I know why. We are meant to be and live so much more. And I am here to help bring awareness of our potential to this world. The universe is inside us. We just do not know it. I just selected the name Quin a few weeks ago. I felt a presence inside me that was strong and wise. And the name Quin appeared. Then recently Archangel Michael interacted with me. And I know then I was Archangel Quin. If anyone feels like they are literally from out of this world, please join.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I know we are here to do something. The topic will probably be revolving around what we are here to do: to help humanity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If anyone has any topics of what we are here to do and how, please bring them. I only know one thing for sure: We have a capability to do so much. But to not realize our full potential. So I (we) are here to bring this awareness to our fellow brothers and sisters around the globe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The following video helped put a lot of the pieces together for me. I hope it helps for you too.

http://www.meetup.com/The-Next-Best-Book/events/199386532/
&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with Lev Grossman&#39;s &quot;The Magicians&quot; several years ago after it was pitched to me as the &quot;very adult Harry Potter&quot; series.  I mean... how could you not? I immediately fell in love with its imaginative complexity. I like to think of it as Harry Potter meets a lot of swearing meets Chronicles of Narnia... really, it&#39;s that awesome!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characteristics that rock:  A boarding school like Hogwarts, cold english countryside, angsty teenagers, passages to other worlds, magical entrance exams and talking beasts.... SOLD!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lev Grossman is coming to Vromans to talk about the THIRD book in The Magicians series entitled The Magician&#39;s Land.  Even if you haven&#39;t read the first two, it&#39;s great exposure to this wonderful series! I urge you all to give it a try.  I have also seen Lev Grossman twice before and he is one of the BEST authors to see live. He is such a cool guy! I look forward to re-meeting him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let&#39;s meet at backdoor of Vromans at 6:45pm or just meet us upstairs in the author event space.

-118.136055End your day with a hike!
http://www.meetup.com/Forte-Animal-Rescue-Social-Club-Wags-Wine-and-Walks/events/199733202/
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll meet at the Japanese Garden and go on an 60+ minute long hike. The hike begins with some serious hills and then flattens out.  Please read our guidelines and make sure you adhere to them!  We have these for the safety of all dogs and hikers.  While this is an on-leash hike, we might encounter dogs who are off leash. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. All dogs are welcome! If your dog is reactive, please keep into consideration your distance to others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. All dogs must wear a martingale, choke chain, harness, or prong collar (no flat collars, under stress dogs can easily slip out/escape from them). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. All leashes must be no longer than six feet (this is a city law). No retractable leashes are allowed (they provide very little control). THIS IS AN ON-LEASH WALK!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. Dogs should not be initially introduced nose to nose, this style of introduction tends to be the most stressful for dogs. After the walk, when dogs are tired and relaxed, feel free to ask owners if your dogs can then meet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5. ONE dog per person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;6. Bring poo bags, water, and treats for your dog.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;7. For details about the park, &lt;a href=&quot;http://parks.lacounty.gov/wps/portal/dpr/parks/kenneth_hahn_state_recreation_area&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://parks.lacounty.gov/wps/portal/dpr/parks/kenneth_hahn_state_recreation_area&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://parks.lacounty.gov/wps/portal/dpr/parks/kenneth_hahn_state_recreation_area&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/7/0/6/600_387618182.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/6/8/e/600_387618062.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/6/b/6/600_387618102.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

http://www.meetup.com/Sierra-Club-Griffith-Park-Hikes/events/196098022/
&lt;p&gt;Come and enjoy a great evening of hiking and conversation with fellow hikers. On Wednesdays, there are generally two conditioning hikes: a slower/more moderate hike and a faster/more strenuous one. (All hikes involve hills; terrain is sometimes steep with uneven footing.) Because hikers are expected to maintain the pace set by hike leaders, most newcomers should start with the slower hike. While multiple hike levels are usually offered, some levels may not be offered on a given evening. &lt;b&gt;Because there are fewer levels on Wednesdays, we ask people with little hiking experience to start with the Tuesday/Thursday hikes.&lt;/b&gt; Hikes begin at 7pm from the north end of Merry-Go-Round lot #2. &lt;i&gt;Newcomers should get there early to fill out a waiver and should carry the waiver card with them when they hike.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to bring&lt;/b&gt;: Bring water and a light jacket in case it gets cold. Hiking boots/shoes are needed for the harder hikes and will be helpful for all hikes; tennis shoes with good tread might be sufficient for the more moderate hikes. Flashlights are optional; many leaders discourage their use except in emergencies. Leashed, well-behaved dogs are at the discretion of the leader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At this time of year, 30-50 hikers typically show up for the Wednesday hikes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/Los+Angeles+CA+90027:4:US&quot;&gt;Check the weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions to Merry-Go-Round Lot #2 (&lt;/b&gt;also known as the &lt;b&gt;Upper Merry-Go-Round parking lot):&lt;/b&gt; From Los Feliz Blvd just west of the 5, take Crystal Springs north into the park; you’ll soon pass a freeway onramp. After around a mile, you’ll come to a 4-way intersection, with the Ranger station on your right. Make a left (going west). At the top of the road you’re forced to turn right into the (unlit) lot #1. Drive through the lot and along the road that leaves the opposite corner. You’ll soon come to lot #2, which is lit. &lt;i&gt;The Sierra Club meets at the far (north) end of the lot, by the stone steps&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Going north on the 5 from Downtown LA, you can also get off at the Griffith Park exit and take Crystal Springs going north, following the directions above. Other routes go from near the Zoo or from Travel Town; you can get directions from this GPS link to lot #1, but you still need to drive through to lot #2:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/qlsvg3&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/qlsvg3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These meetings will be mainly for beginner and intermediate Spanish students. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;During these meetings, we’ll cover a variety of the aspects of the language. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;NEW GAME: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our brand new game is&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;Me puse.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;With this game we&#39;ll learn about how to express your emotions and reactions to events. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Practical Vocabulary &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The more words we know, the more we’re able to express ourselves. You will learn 10 practical vocabulary words at each meeting. You’ll be able to put these words into practice right away by creating sentences with them. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instructional Readings &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most people are visual learners. When we read something out loud, we use more than just one of the senses. We see the information; we say it, and we hear it. That’s why we’ll spend some time reading during each meeting. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Grammar &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Knowing the grammar of the target language is very important; it clarifies many doubts and guides us when we are lost and need to make a decision. We’ll touch upon some grammatical topics during every session. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conversational &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In my opinion, speaking is the most important skill to have when one learns a new language. You’ll have the opportunity to speak, and the benefit of being corrected. I’ll do my best to help you with your pronunciation, so you can sound like a native speaker. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you want more Spanish? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you want to learn and/or practice more Spanish, in a one-on-one setting, call me or text me at [masked], or send me an email at [masked] . &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;INSTRUCCIONES IMPORATANTES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The most important things to bring are a smile and a positive attitude&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/5/e/0/600_377314272.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We’ll be at our new location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New location:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;S.LA.M.

When you get out of the elevator on the first floor, SLAM will be to your right. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Look for a sign like this one: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/6/3/a/600_388093882.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Support our Spanish group by donating what you can. During these meetings you can pay your optional $5-membership fees. You can donate a couple of dollars, $5, or even if it’s only $50 or $100. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;This money helps us to make sure we keep having more events. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;It also helps us pay for the Meetup site fees and the domain and hosting of our website &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elgrupoepico.com&quot;&gt;www.elgrupoepico.com&lt;/a&gt; . &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/a/b/0/600_376566832.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finally, have fun and give us your feedback. The main goal of these meetings is to learn, but also to have fun in the process. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let us know how we are doing, and how we can make our group better. Also, let us know if you have any comments or suggestions. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;We love to hear from you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See you on Wednesday!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;- José&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You will experience the wonders of nature in a new light - the dark. Bring 1-2 liters of water, a flashlight (to not use), warm clothing, and a sense of adventure. We meet at the Marvin Braude park - &lt;b&gt;just OUTSIDE of the park at 7:00pm.&lt;/b&gt; Look for my silver Chevy truck.

&lt;p&gt;The LA g33k d1nner is back and is now on the 2nd Wednesday of every month! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Come see scenic Glendale in August!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;





About the LA G33k D1nner&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone is welcome to attend the g33k d1nner — as long as you are genuinely passionate about technology, science or art. The g33k d1nner is not a traditional networking event focused on dog and pony show and tells. Rather it is the chance to cultivate social and professional relationships. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the news&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s what Alexia Tsotsis at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.laweekly.com/publicspectacle/2008/12/17/last-night-la-geek-dinner-and-creative-commons-6-year-anniversary&quot;&gt;LA Weekly&lt;/a&gt; had to say about the LA Geek Dinners! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Geek Dinners originated as a way to unite the burgeoning L.A. new media scene — a group of people either associated with locally-based Internet companies or working in the digital sectors of the large entertainment conglomerates. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Representing a community just now reaching critical mass, the diners are unique; In contrast to the intellectual capital of the tech heavy-hitters like San Francisco or Palo Alto (each with their own versions of the meet-up), the L.A. Geeks have action capital. Because of its proximity to Hollywood with a capital H, the scene has a greater connection to pop culture and therefore an even greater potential for that all elusive &quot;coolness.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;uWink&#39;s personal interfaces to order their Rock and Roll Quesadillas and Razberri Mojitos, you realize that there are a lot of attractive smart people in Los Angeles and what better place to meet them than a Geek Dinner?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Bring water and a log sleeve shirt if you get chilly. You can bring flash lights but please only the red or green, white lights hurts some people&#39;s eyes. You may bring cameras and (dogs welcome).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to get there&lt;/b&gt; take the Los Feliz/Crystal Springs entrance to the park just off the I5 freeway. Go North on Crystal Springs into the park. At the second stop sign you&#39;ll come to a four way intersection. The ranger station should be on your right. Make a left at that intersection, go up the road a little bit, and you&#39;ll be forced to turn right into merry-go-round lot #1. Just drive through lot #1 and down the road a little ways and you&#39;ll be in lot #2. We meet at the South end.&lt;br/&gt;. My number is [masked] if you get lost or are running late call or text me (if you do not call/text I don&#39;t know that I am waiting for you). If you have any other questions you can email me.=D&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For more fitness advice, I will wright it on my Tumbler.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/blog/lahikingandfitness&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tumblr.com/blog/lahikingandfitness&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://www.tumblr.com/blog/lahikingandfitness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Facebook page &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/lahikingandfitness?ref=hl&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/lahikingandfitness?ref=hl&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/lahikingandfitness?ref=hl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you enjoy my hike, I would greatly appreciate if you chip-in.

Play from 7:10 pm to 8:25 pm, during which time we have three teams rotating so that each team plays 4 ten minutes games/40 minutes total. YOU NEED TO BRING A WHITE (Solid White) AND A DARK (Black, Blue, Orange, Purple, Red) SHIRT . . . . . &lt;b&gt;GRAY IS NOT WHITE OR DARK!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IF YOU WISH TO PLAY IN THIS GAME AND THE OUTDOOR GAME ACROSS THE STREET AT 9:00 PM, YOU NEED TO RESERVE YOUR SPOT ON THIS MEETUP PAGE AND RESERVE YOUR SPOT ON THE 9:00 PM OUTDOOR GAME MEETUP PAGE &lt;b&gt;BUT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;PAY ON THE HOLLYWOOD INDOOR AND OUTDOOR SOCCER PAGE&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;THAT IS LISTED RIGHT AFTER THESE TWO&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;GAMES&lt;/b&gt;. THE PRICE TO PLAY IN BOTH IS $12 ($2 OFF)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ll be forming teams with 5 players each. The goals are standard 4 x 6 so whoever plays goalie cannot use his/her hands to impede the ball from going into the goal but can use their hands to protect their face or “private parts”. Goalies rotate every 5 minutes until everyone has played goalie, then the rotation starts all over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are no set teams; the game organizer divides the players into groups in an attempt to create roughly equal teams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We welcome anyone over 18, both men and women; whether you&#39;re experienced or new to the game. All we ask is that you give it 100%; we value effort over ability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Call your own fouls and respect the call if someone calls a foul on you. We call all hand balls, intentional or not, so a hand ball stops play and no slide tackling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If there are any disputes, the game organizer has the final say, period. We&#39;re looking for people who like to compete but do not go overboard about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re the type of player who harps on other players inadequacies or has a negative attitude if the game doesn&#39;t go your way or you just generally think you&#39;re God&#39;s gift to Soccer, you may want to join a league and pass us by.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We want positive people who enjoy playing with other likeminded individuals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;°SI3A&lt;/p&gt;

http://www.meetup.com/Shoestring-Adventures-LA/events/197887442/
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s break up the work week with a hike on the Temescal Canyon Loop!  This is now a regular Meetup every Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Temescal Gateway Park is located off of PCH at the intersection of Sunset Blvd. and Temescal Canyon Road. Parking is free along Sunset Blvd and Temescal Canyon Road, but there is a charge to park inside the park. Let&#39;s meet at the entrance of the park on Sunset Blvd at 7PM. We should be done around 8:30PM, so bring a head lamp if you have one because it will get dark. The loop is about 2.6 miles with a challenging hill climb.  We should reach the summit just in time to watch the sunset.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bathrooms inside the park are locked, so be prepared.  Sorry, pups are not allowed on this trail :(&lt;/p&gt;

If actors are well-trained we can learn a lot from their performance in what and where to cut. If they are not great at what they do, we need to know what and where to cut to make the story strong even with their unfortunate performance. Drawing from experience as both an actor and cutter and stealing from great editor&#39;s such as Walter Murch, Assistant Professor Aaron Daniel Annas of Vanguard University will host a discussion on how we can continually be better in pacing, structure, and story simply by focusing on the job and skill of the actor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEFINING LOUDNESS: TRACKING AUDIO LEVELS FOR DELIVERY - Woody Woodhall, CAS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the help of iZotope’s Insight Metering Plug-In, LAPPG Co-Founder Woody Woodhall will detail the various loudness measurements required for proper final delivery. Insight allows for simple peak metering to complex spectrogram metering or CALM compliance metering with a timeline that indicates where and when potential problems arise in the mix. This tool is essential for video editors as well as audio engineers to visually monitor the loudness levels in their delivered digital content.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.izotope.com/insight/&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;https://www.izotope.com/insight/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As always there will be plenty of time to network, enjoy some coffee and participate in our great giveaway! $5.00 kindly requested at the door will include 1 giveaway ticket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

He believes performance carries as much importance on the page as it does off. He has performed all over California and in New York, has been a member of and has coached poetry slam teams galore, and hosts SHOUT! the open mic in Uptown Whittier at Half Off Books.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SHOUT! is a recurring poetry open mic that takes place the 2nd Wednesday of each month at 7:00 pm. A free event, and has developed quite a following, so get there early to ensure you read before 9:00 pm, unless you want to be one of those moonlight poets that helps shut the spot down around 12pm. Also, due to the occurrence of the Uptown Street Fair from April-Oct, parking will be difficult, but not impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

http://www.meetup.com/fear-monster-meditation/events/197437432/
&lt;p&gt;Join us on Wednesday evening and learn how to calm your fear monster! This week will be a guided meditation on how to heal old emotional wounds. We&#39;ll learn how to transmute old emotional pain into sacred memories, with love and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is important because it takes away some of the &quot;food&quot; that your fear monster feeds off of. We&#39;ve all been hurt in the past, but if that pain isn&#39;t properly dealt with, naturally it will start to pop up as fear. So if you&#39;d like to learn how to let go of the fear that you&#39;ll be hurt again, and open up your heart to new experiences, this class is for you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doors open at 7:00pm, and we&#39;ll get to know each other while people are gathering. Meditation will start at 7:30 and go for about an hour. Hope you can make it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every class is offered on a donation basis. (Suggestion donation is $15-$20.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;We are meant to be happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That has always been something we strive for in this life. In fact, if we look at the motivations behind our thoughts and action conscious and unconscious they are all to get us closer to the feeling, or at least the idea, of happiness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of us have long asked why we cannot hold on to happiness. For all of the scholarship and human insights across the centuries, nobody has found a complete and enduring answer. Perhaps because it has been too close to see…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The answer, the key, is our heart.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Irmansyah Effendi, M.Sc., Founder Padmacahaya Institute&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Open Heart Meditation is a very easy-to-learn, heart-centered meditation that helps you experience the peace and joy that is already within your heart through the simple technique of relaxing, smiling and surrendering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the Meetup we will walk you through the basic steps (relax, smile and surrender) of heart meditation so you can become familiar with the process, then we will do the Open Heart Meditation together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Open Heart Meditation is a beautiful, guided meditation that connects our hearts to True Source, the Source of Love &amp;amp; Light (we use the non-denominational term &quot;True Source&quot; but you a free to use whatever word feels right for you- God, Spirit, Universe etc...). The Open Heart Meditation also helps cleanse negative energy and emotions from your heart and replace it with Love &amp;amp; Light in a very gentle, surrendered way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most people feel very relaxed and peaceful after the Open Heart Meditation. With practice, as our heart becomes stronger, we become more peaceful, joyful and able to follow our heart&#39;s own inner guidance to be happier in our daily life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have any questions you can contact Jennifer [masked]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We hope you&#39;ll join us Weds nights at 7:30!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Love &amp;amp; Light,&lt;br/&gt;The LA Open Heart Community : )&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;For more information visit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://openheartla.com&quot;&gt;openheartla.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

http://www.meetup.com/SoulDanceLA/events/194513772/
&lt;p&gt;Come join this outrageously fun, friendly, hip, free form dance class  that&#39;s been running non stop for 10 years! All proceeds to charity. The high of going out dancing with the bliss of going within.  We begin with a moving meditation to help you quickly and effectively, gently release what holds you back that you might move into effortless joy, freedom, open-heartedness and connection to your Divine nature. Then we dance out to uplifting current, old school and world dance tunes spun by a pro DJ intersperced with  brief &#39;soul moments&#39; to keep going within and up high that you might be danced by Spirit. We end with a brief meditation and leave you on the floor wringing out the bliss.  No previous Dance experience necessary. Come join the fun and see why folks say things like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Without a doubt this is the best free form dance event in LA!&quot; (Matthew, Entrepreneur)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Better than chocolate, sex, or runner&#39;s hugh, Soul Dance is a time when my Spirit soars and I remember that my body is my living temple of delight.....bliss!&quot; - (LP, Life Coach)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Soul dance is this little magic key that lets me unlock my true, wild, beautiful and uninhibited self...I can start a class with a plate full of worries and by 9pm the joy and lightness I feel is amazing! Spirit&#39;s definitely working with me to let go of &#39;stuff&#39; in these classes. But more than anything I have so much fun!&quot; - ZG, Film Publicist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soul Dance is what I imagine Heave to be! It has changed my life. It&#39;s my ideal of what dancing can be-totally joyous, heart-wrenching, spontaneous. No matter what state I am in when I arrive I leave with a much greater sense of peace, wholeness and connection with Spirit.  A true celebration of life. CS, Opera Singer&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Soul Dance, I&#39;m finding creativity and spontaneity flowing out of me while loving the one who dances in my heart. For the rest of the week my energy level just shoots through the roof! MJ, Professor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dudes who think you can&#39;t dance come to Soul Dance and bring your women and dance with them!  BJ, actor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No words for the transformation that occurs. I walk in feeling one way and walk out transformed! I am becoming addicted and so grateful! The immense loving you bring to this is amazing.

&lt;p&gt;Come join this outrageously fun, friendly, hip, free form dance class  that&#39;s been running non stop for 10 years! All proceeds to charity. The high of going out dancing with the bliss of going within.  We begin with a moving meditation to help you quickly and effectively, gently release what holds you back that you might move into effortless joy, freedom, open-heartedness and connection to your Divine nature. Then we dance out to uplifting current, old school and world dance tunes spun by a pro DJ intersperced with  brief &#39;soul moments&#39; to keep going within and up high that you might be danced by Spirit. We end with a brief meditation and leave you on the floor wringing out the bliss.  No previous Dance experience necessary. Come join the fun and see why folks say things like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Without a doubt this is the best free form dance event in LA!&quot; (Matthew, Entrepreneur)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Better than chocolate, sex, or runner&#39;s hugh, Soul Dance is a time when my Spirit soars and I remember that my body is my living temple of delight.....bliss!&quot; - (LP, Life Coach)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Soul dance is this little magic key that lets me unlock my true, wild, beautiful and uninhibited self...I can start a class with a plate full of worries and by 9pm the joy and lightness I feel is amazing! Spirit&#39;s definitely working with me to let go of &#39;stuff&#39; in these classes. But more than anything I have so much fun!&quot; - ZG, Film Publicist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soul Dance is what I imagine Heave to be! It has changed my life. It&#39;s my ideal of what dancing can be-totally joyous, heart-wrenching, spontaneous. No matter what state I am in when I arrive I leave with a much greater sense of peace, wholeness and connection with Spirit.  A true celebration of life. CS, Opera Singer&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Soul Dance, I&#39;m finding creativity and spontaneity flowing out of me while loving the one who dances in my heart. For the rest of the week my energy level just shoots through the roof! MJ, Professor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dudes who think you can&#39;t dance come to Soul Dance and bring your women and dance with them!  BJ, actor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No words for the transformation that occurs. I walk in feeling one way and walk out transformed! I am becoming addicted and so grateful! The immense loving you bring to this is amazing. AR, CEO, Beauty Company&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;www.SoulDanceLA.Com for more details&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please join our facebook group at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/groups/SoulDanceLove/&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/groups/SoulDanceLove/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Brand new people on the path will find it beneficial as well as those who have had a lifetime of spiritual practice.&lt;br/&gt;You may find more about it on the official website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://acim.org/&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://acim.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://acim.org/&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://acim.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://acim.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://acim.org/&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://acim.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or write to David at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:[masked]&quot;&gt;dspetner [@] beachnet [.] com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group meets weekly on Wednesday evening. Please note that although the word &quot;Course&quot; is in the title, you do not have to sign up for a series. Each meeting is an entity unto its own, so please come join us at any time. While signing up and making the commitment to attend regularly is of compounding benefit that you will experience as you do so. At the very same time, drop-ins are absolutely welcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Course in Miracles is based on the book of the same name, although it&#39;s not necessary to get it to attend this course. You can find the book at the library or order it from the website or any bookstore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt; $15 Donation while No One is Turned Away&lt;br/&gt;Questions to David at 310 ~ 476 ~ 9898 or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:[masked]&quot;&gt;dspetner [@] beachnet [.] com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;The world you see is not the real world. The real world is a joyous place inside you, a way to cope with the outside world and a way to discover God in everything. You are here for a purpose and you will discover that purpose in this course. It creates a new way of thinking and experiencing the world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;About the Facilitator:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;David Spetner, ACIM Instructor, based in West LA, has been a spiritual discoverer for over 30 years.

When/if full, street parking.&lt;br/&gt;_______________________________________&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Housekeeping Notes from Host Location, The GATEWAY:&lt;br/&gt;* Thank you for honoring No Food or Eating or Drinks other than water in containers with lids inside the offices or workshop space of The GATEWAY.&lt;br/&gt;* Cell phones silenced as you enter The GATEWAY Quiet Zones please. Thank you.&lt;br/&gt;* The GATEWAY Portal practices and asks you, its attendees to join us in upholding a no perfume policy as possible. We also practice and ask all to adhere to a no candle and no incense burning policy for those sensitive to synthetic smells as well as for lessening our harmful carbon footprint impact on the environment. Please note that practitioners are permitted to burn a naturally sun dried herb called sage to clean the space energetically. &amp;amp; lastly where candles are part of a sacred ritual, safe, non-scented candles are permitted to be burned upon expressed consent by GATEWAY&#39;s operating director. If you have any further questions on this issue, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you.&lt;br/&gt;* Also, in as much as we LOVE animals outside humans, no animals other than humans are permitted inside The GATEWAY. Blessedly this does not eliminate our Practitioners here at GATEWAY from being able to do work on them, as often they work remotely and/or with photos or props. We thank the universe for Quantum on that. Where necessary, the Practitioner may set up chairs and a portable divider to makeshift a little private area outside near our patio to do hands on work with animals. Thank you so much for your understanding and co-operation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Feel free to check out the whole of GATEWAY&#39;s upcoming calendar at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our official website is &lt;a href=&quot;http://thegatewayportal.com/&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://thegatewayportal.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thegatewayportal.com/&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://thegatewayportal.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thegatewayportal.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thegatewayportal.com/&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://thegatewayportal.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If not already on our mailing list, email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:[masked]&quot;&gt;heart-to-heart [@] thegatewayportal [.] com&lt;/a&gt; indicating you&#39;d like to be added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your interest in this venue.

Brand new people on the path will find it beneficial as well as those who have had a lifetime of spiritual practice.&lt;br/&gt;You may find more about it on the official website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://acim.org/&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://acim.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://acim.org/&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://acim.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://acim.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://acim.org/&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://acim.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or write to David at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:[masked]&quot;&gt;dspetner [@] beachnet [.] com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group meets weekly on Wednesday evening. Please note that although the word &quot;Course&quot; is in the title, you do not have to sign up for a series. Each meeting is an entity unto its own, so please come join us at any time. While signing up and making the commitment to attend regularly is of compounding benefit that you will experience as you do so. At the very same time, drop-ins are absolutely welcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Course in Miracles is based on the book of the same name, although it&#39;s not necessary to get it to attend this course. You can find the book at the library or order it from the website or any bookstore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt; $15 Donation while No One is Turned Away&lt;br/&gt;Questions to David at 310 ~ 476 ~ 9898 or &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:[masked]&quot;&gt;dspetner [@] beachnet [.] com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;The world you see is not the real world. The real world is a joyous place inside you, a way to cope with the outside world and a way to discover God in everything. You are here for a purpose and you will discover that purpose in this course. It creates a new way of thinking and experiencing the world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;About the Facilitator:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;David Spetner, ACIM Instructor, based in West LA, has been a spiritual discoverer for over 30 years. His unique perspective of A Course in Miracles will accelerate your spiritual growth and your success in the Course. Alongside this group he is starting, he also leads a bi-weekly meditation course with a group membership of over 100 people. His background, among many others sources, includes studies of: Eckhart Tolle, Osho, Self-Realization Fellowship, Louise Hay, Marianne Williamson, the Bodhi Center...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mapquest.com/maps?address=2511+S+Barrington+Ave&amp;amp;city=Los+Angeles&amp;amp;state=CA&amp;amp;zipcode=90064&quot;&gt;Map to The GATEWAY Portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free Parking&lt;/b&gt; in attached lot directly behind building first come first serve. When/if full, street parking.&lt;br/&gt;_______________________________________&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Housekeeping Notes from Host Location, The GATEWAY:&lt;br/&gt;* Thank you for honoring No Food or Eating or Drinks other than water in containers with lids inside the offices or workshop space of The GATEWAY.&lt;br/&gt;* Cell phones silenced as you enter The GATEWAY Quiet Zones please. Thank you.&lt;br/&gt;* The GATEWAY Portal practices and asks you, its attendees to join us in upholding a no perfume policy as possible. We also practice and ask all to adhere to a no candle and no incense burning policy for those sensitive to synthetic smells as well as for lessening our harmful carbon footprint impact on the environment. Please note that practitioners are permitted to burn a naturally sun dried herb called sage to clean the space energetically. &amp;amp; lastly where candles are part of a sacred ritual, safe, non-scented candles are permitted to be burned upon expressed consent by GATEWAY&#39;s operating director. If you have any further questions on this issue, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you.&lt;br/&gt;* Also, in as much as we LOVE animals outside humans, no animals other than humans are permitted inside The GATEWAY. Blessedly this does not eliminate our Practitioners here at GATEWAY from being able to do work on them, as often they work remotely and/or with photos or props. We thank the universe for Quantum on that. Where necessary, the Practitioner may set up chairs and a portable divider to makeshift a little private area outside near our patio to do hands on work with animals. Thank you so much for your understanding and co-operation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Feel free to check out the whole of GATEWAY&#39;s upcoming calendar at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://www.meetup.com/TheGATEWAYPortal/events/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our official website is &lt;a href=&quot;http://thegatewayportal.com/&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://thegatewayportal.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thegatewayportal.com/&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://thegatewayportal.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thegatewayportal.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thegatewayportal.com/&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://thegatewayportal.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If not already on our mailing list, email &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:[masked]&quot;&gt;heart-to-heart [@] thegatewayportal [.] com&lt;/a&gt; indicating you&#39;d like to be added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your interest in this venue. Please visit us often, as we love your company &lt;br/&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;br/&gt;as inspired, feel free to spread the word with anyone you know that we may also serve.&lt;/p&gt;

-118.443383Celebrate Ken&#39;s Birthday @The Blue Room!
http://www.meetup.com/Year-Long-Pub-Crawl-North-Hollywood/events/199431652/
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s celebrate ME!  =D   This weekend is my birthday and I&#39;d be psyched to celebrate it with all of you next Wednesday at The Blue Room!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;


Located next door to the Corner Bar, where we had a GREAT time earlier this year, The Blue Room is one of the valley&#39;s oldest bars.  It has been family owned and operated for over 60 years!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;


I spoke to John at the Blue Room and they will be expecting us.  The Blue Room does not serve food but allows outside food to be brought in.   I am planning on ordering a bunch of pizzas.  Please let me know in the comments below if you think you&#39;ll be having a slice or two (might be a couple bucks per slice).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;


Looking forward to celebrating with you soon!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

http://www.meetup.com/Orange-County-Art-and-Culture/events/191376342/
&lt;p&gt;Ever since the Enlightenment, humans have worshipped at the altar of the lone genius: the poet in the garret, the painter in the studio, the scientist yelling eureka in an empty laboratory. There is something so inexplicable about creativity that it seems best understood through the stories of those rare minds that come along once in a generation. But few people work and live in isolation. In fact, many of our most brilliant artists and innovators have created in partnerships. Some of these are well-known (John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Pierre and Marie Curie); others have taken place largely in the shadows (Vincent and Theo van Gogh, Emily Dickinson and Thomas Wentworth Higginson). What can these pairs teach us about genius and innovation? Is creativity a fundamentally social act? Writer Joshua Wolf Shenk, author of Powers of Two, visits Zócalo to discuss the science and history of collaboration, and why two is a magic number.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/1/3/4/600_379777172.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moderated by Jonathan Ames, Creator of the TV Show Bored to Death&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ABOUT ZOCALO:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/0/d/a/600_379777082.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zócalo Public Square, a project of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cohesion.asu.edu/&quot;&gt;Center for Social Cohesion at Arizona State University&lt;/a&gt;, is a not-for-profit Ideas Exchange that blends live events and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/definition-of-humanities-journalism/&quot;&gt;humanities journalism&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Many of our dancers arent on Meetup, or just dont update all this info as they should (myself included). So the attendance info is highly inaccurate--keeping it right in line with, well, everything about us.&lt;br/&gt;remember, don&#39;t just show up! If we&#39;re very very busy, we&#39;re liable to get grumpy. And grumpy folk with big sticks is a bad combo.&lt;br/&gt;Even worse: Grumpy hung over people with big sticks (see: Sunday morning at an Ale. Don&#39;t know what an Ale is? Well, join us and you can find out!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IF YOU HAVE RSVP&#39;d FOR THE EARLY GAME (7:00 PM - 8:30 PM) YOU CAN&#39;T RSVP FOR THIS GAME&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; IF YOU ARE RSVP&#39;d FOR BOTH, YOU WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REMOVED FROM THIS GAME&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have the gym from 8:30 pm to 9:55 pm; warm-up from 8:30 pm to 8:40 pm. Play from 8:40 pm to 9:55 pm, during which time we have three teams rotating so that each team plays 4 ten minutes games/40 minutes total. YOU NEED TO BRING A WHITE (Solid White) AND A DARK (Black, Blue, Orange, Purple, Red) SHIRT . . . . . &lt;b&gt;GRAY IS NOT WHITE OR DARK!!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ll be forming teams with 5 players each. The goals are standard 4 x 6 so whoever plays goalie cannot use his/her hands to impede the ball from going into the goal but can use their hands to protect their face or “private parts”. Goalies rotate every 5 minutes until everyone has played goalie, then the rotation starts all over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are no set teams; the game organizer divides the players into groups in an attempt to create roughly equal teams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We welcome anyone over 18, both men and women; whether you&#39;re experienced or new to the game. All we ask is that you give it 100%; we value effort over ability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Call your own fouls and respect the call if someone calls a foul on you. We call all hand balls, intentional or not, so a hand ball stops play and no slide tackling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If there are any disputes, the game organizer has the final say, period. We&#39;re looking for people who like to compete but do not go overboard about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re the type of player who harps on other players inadequacies or has a negative attitude if the game doesn&#39;t go your way or you just generally think you&#39;re God&#39;s gift to Soccer, you may want to join a league and pass us by.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We want positive people who enjoy playing with other likeminded individuals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;°SI3B&lt;/p&gt;

-71.138939Options Monthly Meeting for Boston Traders Meetup
http://www.meetup.com/BostonTraders/events/188985022/
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Boston Traders Meetup will be hosting a monthly options meeting to discuss options trading.&lt;/b&gt; This will be an informal gathering of folks who trade options who would like to share their knowledge and learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beginners and experienced traders are welcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This event will be held on the Thursday evening before the monthly expiration Friday.* Holding the meeting at monthly expiration will allow people to discuss the trades that they have put on during the prior month and perhaps to share ideas for trades to put on in the next month. For weekly options traders, the monthly expiry is of little significance unto itself, but for the monthly options traders, it will hold more significance. &lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mary-Lou Drozek&lt;/b&gt; will be moderating this meeting. She has been trading options for about 5 years and is happy to share ideas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/4/8/a/a/600_374778602.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The meeting location is Panera Bread in Quincy, which has wifi and is visible from the North Quincy T stop on the Red Line. The location could possibly change, so please check back with the event page just to confirm the location before heading off to the meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;* Meetup allows for scheduling &quot;the third Thursday of the month,&quot; but not the &quot;Thursday before the third Friday of the month,&quot; which is what we need. Using the Meetup scheduling system alone without intervention would mean that the third Thursday will be on expiration week except for those months starting on a Friday, as is the case in August of 2014; in which case, the meeting would fall a week after the monthly expiry week. We believe that we will be able to successfully manipulate this consideration in the meetup system to keep the meetings all on the Thursday evening before expiration Friday. If you see a meeting time that isn&#39;t the Thursday evening before expiration Friday, please let us know and we will correct it. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

People of all ages and abilities are encouraged to come get fit and make new friends while enjoying the beauty of the Esplanade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 2014 season begins July 7th and runs through September 11th. Thanks to our partners we are able to offer a great range of programs including favorites from last season as well as exciting new classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Refreshments provided by Polar Beverages and CLIF MOJO.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coaches will teach you good form and techniques and postures.

&lt;p&gt;At the June meeting, several new members expressed an interest in a joint robot build. We have group purchased the necessary parts. We meet for a night of robot construction. A simple wheeled acrylic robot with Ultrasonic &amp;amp; IR sensors with an Arduino brain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Check followup messages &amp;amp; emails for more info&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt; members have purchased kits.  I have decided to close orders.  We can have another session in September for enhancing the robots and for others to catchup if any late deliveries.  Perhaps a new round can occur in October/November.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I probably should have included a IR remote control in the kit. I will bring some to the meeting.  They cost $5.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

Fixtures come with a few drawbacks though; the structure is almost always different from a real API response, and they don&#39;t go through a network request stack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll step through the lifecycle of developing a new feature by using adapters in Ember Data to point a new section of an app to a mock API server. We&#39;ll use Ember to drive our API design using the mock server. Finally, we can implement the newly designed API on the back-end and remove our custom adapter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ember-cli has a great built-in mock server as of version 0.0.28. If you&#39;re not using ember-cli, we&#39;ll walk through how to set up a manual equivalent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;


&lt;b&gt;John Huynh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WebSocket Adapter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The talk is focused around John&#39;s initial implementation of a WebSocket adapter. Along the way, he&#39;ll talk about how he used Ember Data’s adapters and serializers. He&#39;ll draw some parallels to some networking concepts (packets and layers). John&#39;s talk&#39;s takeaway will be general knowledge about Ember Data’s adapters and serializers. APIs are diverse so working with Ember Data’s adapters and serializers are unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community Healing Circle (donations accepted for space)&lt;br/&gt;Healing for yourself, others and the planet&lt;br/&gt;Group healing is very powerful and we all have natural healing abilities. In this group we will gather in a circle, with each person taking a turn in the center to receive healing from those around you, either hands on or above the body (your choice).  You may choose to receive healing only, or provide healing only, or give and receive; your choice. Following this we  will  offer our healing for those not present, and for the planet. Situations, and events around the world could use some healing right now. Bring a drum or rattle to add another dimension to our healing experience. This is  an evening of service, to ourselves and others. This is one of many ways we can serve, to help bring heaven on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

This unique, carefully designed meditation with the Awakending Stone &quot;Selenite&quot; along with the Crystal singing Pyramids activates deep Joy within, and expands your etheric field, as your Angels and Guides support you along the way.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Process: You will have a large slab of Selenite to place underfoot (while seated) or under your head (while lying down), and two smaller pieces to hold in each hand. As the crystal singing pyramids are played, you will be guided through a series of meditations and contemplations related to clearing each of your major energy centers (chakras). Nicki will intersperse the meditations with information on and stories about her journey with Selenite.  Please call to Register [masked] - $44.00&lt;/p&gt;

This meeting currently does not have any presentations, and is more of a meet and greet. I will also be cutting some parts on the laser cutter, and you can too! If you have something to present, send a message to the organizer or comment on this meetup.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The venue has a $12/head charge, but that can be applied to time on the laser cutter during the event (This might be changing in the future).

http://www.meetup.com/Openstack-Boston/events/189349082/
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HP&lt;/b&gt; will be sponsoring our Aug. Meetup and will be presenting these interesting topics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1) It&#39;s very difficult, if not impossible, to fix a broken complex system if you don&#39;t have a good understanding of how it&#39;s supposed to work. I use a personal story to make this point, and then challenge the OpenStack community at all levels to take &lt;b&gt;serviceability aspects&lt;/b&gt; into account when using or contributing to any of the component projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2) &lt;b&gt;Benchmarking Swift Performance&lt;/b&gt; - If you are an existing swift user and are wondering how well it is actually performing, this talk will introduce you to the swift benchmarking tool, getput, which will allow you to measure swift performance across a broad variety of scenarios and loads. Some of the questions it would help answer is does you application achieve the same level of performance getput is demonstrating?  What effect will changing your configuration have on performance?  What effect might multi-threading have on improving performance?  How well does your implementation of swift compare to others? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This talk will cover the basics of using getput as well as running a demo of some of its more interesting use cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speaker Bio&#39;s:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Harry Sutton&lt;/b&gt;, a thirty-nine year veteran of the IT industry, is the Global Lead for HP’s Professions Program. Harry is a TCP Master Technologist working in Andover, Massachusetts in HP’s Technology Services organization. He lives in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and enjoys spending time with his wife and their extended family of pets, especially his African Grey parrot, Toby.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mark Seger&lt;/b&gt;, Mark has been focused on large cluster performance over the last 15 years and is the author of collectl, a performance monitoring tool that has been used on many of the largest High Performance Computing clusters in the world. His focus in HPC has been of solving performance problems at high levels of scale and has brought many of those methodologies to addressing performance problems in an OpenStack environment.  He has also developed another opensource tool focused on Swift Benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reminders:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A light dinner and soft drinks will be provided ~ 6:30pm &lt;b&gt;courtesy of HP&lt;/b&gt;, and we will kick off the sessions ~ 7:00pm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are interested in giving a &lt;b&gt;Lightening Talk&lt;/b&gt; shoot us a note with a topic or just come to the session ready to speak!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;b&gt;DON&#39;T FORGET&lt;/b&gt; - for security reasons, the NERD center requires atendees to show a government issued photo ID in order to gain access into the building.

http://www.meetup.com/A-Course-In-Miracles-Discussion-Group-Carlisle/events/177207842/
&lt;p&gt;A Course In Miracles has been translated into 23 languages, is referenced and utilized by many of today&#39;s most reknowned spiritual teachers, and has inspired countless books and curriculums based on its teachings. But it can be a difficult book to grasp. It is lengthy, the writing is abstract, and its use of Christian terminology alienates many.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet it has become one of the most influential spiritual books of today. Join us as we dive into it, and are led to understand its principles against the backdrop of our own personal experiences and insights. Beginner as well as advanced Course students are welcome. We&#39;ll start with a short meditation, and then use a reading from the Course as an entry point into our time together. Cost $5 per person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bringing a copy of the book is helpful, but not necessary. Recommended (but again not necessary) is the combined volume that includes the three supplements (Clarification of Terms; Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, and Practice; The Song of Prayer), available online from The Foundation For Inner Peace at &lt;a href=&quot;http://acim.org&quot;&gt;acim.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Organizer: Joe Ciarcia - [masked]&lt;br/&gt;ONLY RSVP IF YOU ARE ATTENDING.&lt;/b&gt; You do not need to RSVP if you are not attending.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;=========================&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read the entire description before you RSVP and answer all of the questions that are part of the RSVP process. Failure to answer them will result in your removal from this event.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you underestimate the demands of this event; overestimate your experience, knowledge, skills or abilities; or come unprepared you put yourself or others at risk so consider this before you decide to participate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;=========================&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What We&#39;re Doing...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, yes... this hike is on a &lt;b&gt;FRIDAY&lt;/b&gt; (that is not a typo). We&#39;ll be hiking &lt;b&gt;North Twin, South Twin,&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Garfield&lt;/b&gt; for the fantastic views and &lt;b&gt;Galehead&lt;/b&gt; because... well because it&#39;s kind of on the way (and my dogs need it for their 48s).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Distance: &lt;b&gt;15.56&lt;/b&gt; mi&lt;br/&gt;Book Time: &lt;b&gt;10 hr 34&lt;/b&gt; min&lt;br/&gt;Elev Gain +5573 ft&lt;br/&gt;Elev Loss -5893 ft&lt;br/&gt;Elev Change -320 ft&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This hike is rated as &lt;b&gt;ADVANCED&lt;/b&gt; due to the distance and elevation gain. &lt;b&gt;Our pace for this hike will be faster than book time&lt;/b&gt; (with breaks included, I would like to finish in book time which translates to a faster than book time pace as book time does not account for breaks).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guests are not permitted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dogs are permitted&lt;/b&gt; - Just like humans, dogs need to be in good shape to do this hike. Be sure to bring a leash in case you need to use it and a copy of their current rabies vaccination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Group Etiquette&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We start as a group, hike as a group, and finish as a group. Our pace will be that of the slowest hiker. This trip isn&#39;t for you if you are faster than the group and don&#39;t want to stay with us, if you want to head off on your own, or if you are slower than the group and expect us to constantly wait for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You need to become self-reliant by learning about the route and potential hazards since you are ultimately responsible for your own safety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What to Bring...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current WX is predicting rain on the days leading up to this hike. There is a crossing which may or may not require wading. Bring water shoes, Crocs, or something you don&#39;t mind changing into and getting wet. Make sure you have a headlamp just in case. Use this link for a list of items needed for a three season day hike:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;http://files.meetup.com/492954/Three_Season_Dayhike_gear_list.pdf&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://files.meetup.com/492954/Three_Season_Dayhike_gear_list.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do not rely on others to have extra items to share with you at the meeting spot or on the trail. You should know how to use all of your equipment - test and adjust it prior to this trip. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weather...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dangerous weather conditions will cancel this event - I will post an update and/or send an email to all confirmed participants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use this link for the current weather forecast:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href=&quot;http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=44.18533700500046&amp;amp;lon=-71.57368683299967&quot;&gt;Weather Forecast for Mt. Galehead&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;


&lt;b&gt;Directions...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will meet at the Garfield Trailhead which is off of Rt. 3 to spot cars and then we will drive over to the North Twin Trailhead. According to Google Maps it is 2 hours and 17 minutes from Boston without traffic, and 148 miles. I&#39;m going to be extra explicit with directions as Garmin GPSes and some apps (AHEM...

Once we are in clear waters we will be taking turns at the tiller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will be sailing in the Boston inner harbor, and might venture out and sail around one of the Boston Harbor Islands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;we will sail on&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boston 27 (Based on Soling) , Sonar, or Soling. You can learn more about these boats here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostonharborsailing.com/fleet_boston27.html&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostonharborsailing.com/fleet_boston27.html&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://www.bostonharborsailing.com/fleet_boston27.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;to expect&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A laid back and safe sailing adventure to the extent it is possible on the racing boat without the engine or bathroom in the busy harbor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In perfect conditions Boston 27 is a comfortable boat to sail on, but in the strong winds boat will lean and you might get splashed. On a windy day be prepared to pull on the ropes, move around, get splashed, and not have much down-time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be warned that it can get stressful at times and we will need to react quickly. Here are some common stressful situations: Drifting towards other boats on the mooring field, drifting towards shore, not being able to grab a hold of the mooring rope, getting yelled at by the coast guard patrol, getting stuck in the middle of the harbor. Remember, these boats don’t have engines and we will have to rely on the wind power. During stressful situations it is important to stay calm and to work as a team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;will be on the boat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two flotation pillows and four life jackets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;is important&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Safety will be our number one priority. I will give a safety crash course once we are on the boat. I recommend that everyone wears a life jacket.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;to bring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sunscreen, hat, sunglasses, water, and a cell phone. Sailing Boston 27 or Soling on a windy day can get you splashed. I would recommend bringing a change of clothes and getting a waterproof case for you cell phone or wrapping it in a plastic bag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;I will bring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My own gear, two-way UHF floating radio pre-programmed with the sailing club and Coast Guard channels and a winch handle to help tighten the sails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important Disclaimer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sailing can be and will be stressful at times.&lt;br/&gt;It is unlikely but is possible to sustain an injury during sailing. I will try to ensure that we have a safe sailing adventure but be advised that getting scratched or hurt occasionally is considered part of the sport.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/7/4/e/600_265510062.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

http://www.meetup.com/Photoworks/events/197978842/
&lt;p&gt;Light painting is challenging and fun.  Make your subject the human body and you have a recipe for a fascinating and unusual evening.pour model will pose for us while we use a variety of flashlights to illuminate areas of skin to produce artful body-shapes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will learn the techniques of body-painting with light which because of the subtle movement of the body produce interesting soft-focus images.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Varying the amount of &quot;painting&quot;  on parts of the body will highlight them or leave them in shadow. The trick is to control the amount of light to create these areas intentionally rather than by accident. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of the nature of this technique, which requires complete darkness and long exposures from a tripod the number of participants will be limited to just four. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cost is $150.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

-71.019905Akashic Records Weekend with Linda Howe, in person!
http://www.meetup.com/Akashic-Record-Boston/events/191151092/
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building the Bridge to Your Destiny through the Akashic Records Weekend Workshop: Transforming Today&#39;s Dreams into Tomorrow&#39;s Reality on a Path of Inspiration and Action&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A primary opportunity of our time is establishing appropriate patterns of authentic thought, feeling and action, for facilitating optimal self-expression, participation and contribution to the world. This requires ever-expanding growth into unconditional love for one’s self and others, appreciation of freedom as a spiritual practice, and awareness of mundane matters of human existence as a sacred opportunity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this weekend, we will explore: our unique usefulness in this life, appropriate letting go, making peace with not knowing, and making conscious choices based on empowering questions. Finally, you will learn the spiritual practice of personal freedom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Friday:&lt;/b&gt; August 15: 7:00 pm - 9:30 pm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saturday:&lt;/b&gt; August 16: 9:30 am - 5:30 pm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunday:&lt;/b&gt; August 17: 9:30 am - 3:30 pm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A certificate from The Linda Howe Center for Akashic Studies will be given to all those completing the course. The cost for this course is $375.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please contact Circles of Wisdom to register:  [masked] or visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.circlesofwisdom.com/Building_the_Bridge_to_Your_De_P6600.cfm&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.circlesofwisdom.com/Building_the_Bridge_to_Your_De_P6600.cfm&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://www.circlesofwisdom.com/Building_the_Bridge_to_Your_De_P6600.cfm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Course will be held at Circles of Wisdom.

http://www.meetup.com/GBNight/events/197645652/
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s revisit the other side of Zakim, which has many different sights to explore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will start and meet at point B (not A) in &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=42.368612,-71.072981&amp;amp;daddr=Museum+Way+to:Unknown+road+to:Unknown+road+to:Unknown+road+to:42.3693469,-71.0662705+to:N+Bank+Bridge+to:Unknown+road&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ll=42.369293,-71.066962&amp;amp;spn=0.004249,0.007253&amp;amp;sll=42.369896,-71.066093&amp;amp;sspn=0.008497,0.014505&amp;amp;geocode=FWR-hgIdK4PD-w%3BFbZ_hgIdTobD-w%3BFQR-hgId2I_D-w%3BFZl_hgId8ZLD-w%3BFZ-BhgIdg5rD-w%3BFUKBhgIdYp3D-yn1wZyNk3DjiTHxr4stOkjzgQ%3BFYiChgIdUKDD-w%3BFQyGhgIdV5bD-w&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;dirflg=w&amp;amp;mra=mi&amp;amp;mrsp=7&amp;amp;sz=16&amp;amp;via=5&amp;amp;z=17&quot;&gt;this map here&lt;/a&gt; (open the link in your mobile browser, not the maps app), which is underneath the train tracks, right across from the Science Center. You can park either in that street (if you&#39;re lucky) or in the Science Center parking garage ($11, closes at 11 pm). We will end up on the roof top of the Science Center parking garage, which gives you a great view on the Charles River or on the Zakim in the background with cars going by in the foreground street, see below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Moon won&#39;t rise until past 11, sun sets at 7:45. We will make our way along points B, C, D, E, F and G (without the redundant back and forth shown in the map, you can walk directly). Point F is the new pedestrian&#39;s bridge, which is very photogenic, point G is interesting, as it gets you a view on the Zakim with some of the highway loops above. People can choose to cross the bridge and shoot under the Zakim or go back to the top of the Science Center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suggested equipment: solid shoes, tripod, camera, intervalometer/remote (urban startrails above the Zakim, anyone?). Lenses: super wide to 100 mm (full frame) will all work well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is where we will meet: right under the bridge across from the Science Center. You can see North Point Park (which we will cross with points B, C, D, E) and the Zakim in the back left.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/3/c/600_392292092.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pedestrian bridge:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/f/9/6/600_392292182.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sweep:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/0/5/4/600_392292372.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And a great image taken by our member Anthony Kong (called the &quot;A-Kong perspective&quot;):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/1/9/e/600_392292702.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

http://www.meetup.com/SSGBoston/events/198758142/
&lt;p&gt;Thursday nights are generally for more experienced students, as we work through some different parts of Fiore&#39;s works in a more open format.  New students should take our beginners&#39; class first, or contact our instructors for more information.  We&#39;re happy to have visiting scholars from other programs come and play!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We practice &lt;i&gt;L&#39;Arte D&#39;Armizare&lt;/i&gt; (The Art of Bearing Arms), a historical European martial art. Our main sources of interpretation are the books (c.1410-1420) of Fiore dei Liberi, a fencing master from Friuli (thus the non-standard Italian spellings!).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/SSGBoston/pages/Level_1_Curriculum/&quot;&gt;Our students work on a combination&lt;/a&gt; of longsword, &lt;i&gt;abrazzare&lt;/i&gt; (grappling), &lt;i&gt;daga&lt;/i&gt; (dagger/knife) and other weapon skills. These skills are drawn from direct translation from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/SSGBoston/pages/Beginning_Resources_%28Written%29/&quot;&gt;historical sources&lt;/a&gt;, developed through multiple physical interpretations and tested at speed. Though we emphasize historical technique, our training sessions are a blend of warmup, interpretation, drill, and for men and women who&#39;ve passed our safety standards, both focused and open sparring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

If you wear grey you may be asked to wear a light or dark &quot;pinnie of shame.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arrive on time to be guaranteed a spot in a game&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RSVP is recommended so you can be notified if the game is canceled&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bring WATER!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are a regular, please consider bringing a buck for the Frisbee Fund&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As usual, we will supply the frisbees, cones, first aid supplies (hopefully will never be used) and our pretty smiles. As we periodically mention, all these supplies are paid out-of-pocket by your loving Frisbee organizers and everyone has been so generous with their donations to-date.

0.0Weekly Walden Open Water Swim
http://www.meetup.com/EventHorizon/events/196590422/
&lt;p&gt;This is the reoccurring meetup for the weekly open water swims at Walden Pond. A well attended venue for triathletes training for races of all distances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gate opens at 7 a.m. and the Parking is right off of Walden St. Walden charges to park a their lot ($5) via a computerized parking attendant that takes cards. I&#39;d recommend the annual pass if you think you&#39;re going to come to more meetups. Alternatively, &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=Concord+High+School,+concord+ma&amp;amp;daddr=915+Walden+Street,+Concord,+MA&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sll=38.93711,-75.966775&amp;amp;sspn=13.846355,14.128418&amp;amp;geocode=FRa1hwIdrlO_-yEidG069HujIg%3BFQqXhwIdjYW_-ylB1q82q5vjiTFsmsu3RKWVtQ&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;mra=ls&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;z=16&quot;&gt;It&#39;s a short distance from Concord High School&lt;/a&gt;. Some people avoid the parking fee by parking near Concord High School and then walk/ride their bike over to Walden. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/trails/walden.pdf&quot;&gt;Click here for the map of the parking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/f/f/4/event_118056852.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Across and back from the beach (Pictured above) is a little over a mile mile; a perfect distance for those training for 70.3 and Ironman races.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also some close to shore routes for people getting better acquainted with open water (see distance maps). We meet near the lifeguard house right on the beach closes to Walden street. Here is the map of walden pond.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This meetup is important because you always want to swim in groups if you can. Make certain that you look out for each other. Don&#39;t attempt to swim across the pond if you haven&#39;t trained for that distance. Always match up with someone or a group that swims your pace. The beauty of Walden is that you can swim very close to shallow water and get some good open water training in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If there are people that are looking to go long for the first time, let me know in advance and I may be able to swim angel, or get a swim angel group together. That way we can do it in a controlled and safe environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those that are really new and nervous about open water swimming, stay tuned for a beginners clinic that I&#39;ll put on in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;

http://www.meetup.com/boston-tennis/events/199995802/
&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a great group for any skill level.  People will match themselves up for mixed doubles play for social and skill play.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are extending the hours so that folks who would like to begin earlier at a cooler time of day can do so.  Feel free to arrive later; however, I would suggest arriving no later than 11 a.m.  If you arrive later, you may need to wait for a set to finish before rotating into play or for another member to arrive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our regular spot is under construction for a few months.  Newton South High School is our current replacement home. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is no public transportation on Sat/Sun.  Please contact post a if you would like some carpooling assistance.  Many folk are glad to help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;



Directions from the high school website are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From Route 95/128: Travel North or South on Route 95/128 to Route 9 East. Take Route 9 East to the Parker Street Exit (this exit will say Newton Centre/West Roxbury on the sign). Turn Right on Parker Street to Hagen. Turn Left on Hagen and follow around to Brandeis Road. Turn left on Brandeis Road to the High School. The football field and soccer fields are the first entrance to the school parking lot. For the tennis courts and fieldhouse, follow Brandeis around to the other side of the school until you see the parking lot by the tennis courts. From&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

We will also feature top authors and sabermetricians from your favorite websites, such as Ben Baumer, Mitchel Lichtman (MGL), Baseball Prospectus (Analysts Dan Brooks and Harry Pavlidis) and Fangraphs (Editor/Author Dave Cameron and Analyst Matt Swartz). There will be a front office intern panel discussing what it takes to get your start in baseball, and talks on sports medicine, defensive evaluation, the role of statistics in the media… and more! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During this event, you will grasp how science is blended with advanced baseball statistics and traditional scouting assessments to produce outstanding results for teams. Don’t miss this special opportunity to learn about the deeper game of baseball from insiders and pros, meet people who love the game, and help the Jimmy Fund.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Saberseminar 2014 has grown to include the generous support of several major league teams. We thank the Red Sox, Astros, Orioles, Royals, Mets, and Nationals for joining us in our fight against cancer. We would also like to acknowledge our hosts for this year, Boston University, and our keynote sponsor, Fangraphs, as well as the Brockton Rox, Collegesplits, Sportvision, The Fantasy Fix, Draftstreet, and Baseball Prospectus. The continued support of these great organizations makes this event possible each year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

Just as in previous years, every one of the speakers at this event (who are not only incredible baseball resources, but are also amazingly altruistic) will be donating their time to participate in this seminar. Every penny earned during this baseball weekend will go directly to the Jimmy Fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information or detailed questions, please check our website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://saberseminar.com/&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://saberseminar.com/&lt;/a&gt; or email [masked] Tickets are limited to 200, and they are going fast, so if you are interested in attending this amazing event get yours soon. &lt;/p&gt;

Since it&#39;s an out and back we can spread out at different paces to accommodate beginner to advanced runners, but still start and finish together.  Coffee/goodies at the cafe afterwards is also optional but highly recommended :-).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a great way to get into running, introduce your friends to the group, or just start your Saturday on a high note.  All ages and levels welcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are hesitating to come, keep in mind that nearly every week we have beginning runners who use a run/walk/run technique.  If you take walk breaks you will probably not be alone, and it&#39;s the best way to get into running.  Well, at least, it worked for me.  So come on out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We practice &lt;i&gt;L&#39;Arte D&#39;Armizare&lt;/i&gt; (The Art of Bearing Arms), a historical European martial art. Our main sources of interpretation are the books (c.1410-1420) of Fiore dei Liberi, a fencing master from Friuli (thus the non-standard Italian spellings!).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/SSGBoston/pages/Level_1_Curriculum/&quot;&gt;Our students work on a combination&lt;/a&gt; of longsword, &lt;i&gt;abrazzare&lt;/i&gt; (grappling), &lt;i&gt;daga&lt;/i&gt; (dagger/knife) and other weapon skills. These skills are drawn from direct translation from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/SSGBoston/pages/Beginning_Resources_%28Written%29/&quot;&gt;historical sources&lt;/a&gt;, developed through multiple physical interpretations and tested at speed. Though we emphasize historical technique, our training sessions are a blend of warmup, interpretation, drill, and for men and women who&#39;ve passed our safety standards, both focused and open sparring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New students should take our beginners&#39; class first, or contact our instructors for more information.  We&#39;re happy to have visiting scholars from other programs come and play!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See you there!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Desirae King&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While pursuing a career in Audio &amp;amp; Media Technology at The New England Institute of Art, I found myself interested in running a music distribution company on the side of my other career goals.  I figured if I could build and manage my own website, In addition to learning some new useful skills, I would be able to save money that I would have spent on a developer.   AA couple web classes later, I realized that I much rather would spent 20 hours coding a website than 2 hours in the studio recording.  I switched my major the next semester and graduated with  a BS in Web Design and Interactive Development in 2010. During my time at NEiA, I was a teacher&#39;s assistant and tutor for various web and video classes.  I make learning a priority in my life and love to share the knowledge and skills that I learn whenever I get the opportunity. I have had the pleasure of building websites and emails for companies such as America&#39;s Test Kitchen, Neoscape, Boston Neighborhood Network and Putnam Investments.  Currently I am a web developer for Bose as of January &#39;13.  I&#39;m really looking forward to aiding in cultivating some new (or brushing up some existing) skill sets with women on their quest towards development. I&#39;m excited to have the opportunity to work with Girl Develop It to give back to the community of women in technology. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;

http://www.meetup.com/mass-wilderness-survival/events/198736642/
&lt;p&gt;This will be a shorter than usual trip. We will start Saturday morning and spend the night, heading back home Sunday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hi all, Since this will be a short trip lets keep it fairly simple. We will concentrate on using as little gear as possible. Please bring a sleeping bag, bivy and rain gear but plan on using none of it. Bring water or the means to treat stream water. We will build individual shelters, make fires and see just how comfy you can get without using modern camping gear. There are no food restrictions on this trip so bring dinner and snacks for your self. For safety sake feel free to &quot;bring&quot; any gear that you want to but keep in mind that the purpose of this is to make due with as little of it as possible. Think of all the items on the previously mentioned list as your Safety Kit. It will be there if you want it, but we will show you that you don&#39;t need it. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who want to challenge themselves try this: you are out for a day hike in, lets say, the White Mountains. All you have is your day pack and what you would normally carry in it on day hike (no cheating). you find yourself lost or hurt or just running very late and need to spend the night with only what you have with you. give it a try and see if you change what you carry on a standard day hike after. PLEASE BRING ALL SAFETY GREAR but plan on using only what is in your daypack. For those who want to try we can discuss what we have before the challenge starts!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;feel free to send thoughts and suggestions!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Todd&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make note of a few things: Here is the link for the basic equipment list &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/mass-wilderness-survival/pages/Outing_Equipment_List%3A_General&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/mass-wilderness-survival/pages/Outing_Equipment_List%3A_General&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://www.meetup.com/mass-wilderness-survival/pages/Outing_Equipment_List%3A_General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catamounttrees.com&quot;&gt;www.catamounttrees.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone that attended the adventure park we went to in Storrs, CT had a great time. This park is further away (2 hours 15 minutes from Boston), but is larger and has more ziplining in addition to more courses, including a double-black course that wasn’t available at Storrs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compared to Storrs, Catamount is a bit more expensive ($51 vs $38/person). But you are given an extra hour to enjoy the obstacles (3 hours instead 2 hours at Storrs). Also there are ways around to get a discount such as booking a group of at least 15 people to get $5 off or buying a book of 5 admissions at least 24 hours before visiting for a $4 discount. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carpooling&lt;/b&gt; is encouraged. Please indicate if you can give a ride or if you need a ride. And always indicate what town and/or t stop you can meet at. This will help facilitate the carpools. You can post your comments.

0.0BOS/Cambridge - Fundamental Fiore: Sword, Dagger and Grappling (Summer 2)
http://www.meetup.com/SSGBoston/events/187507172/
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(a set of 4 Saturday classes)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Always wanted to learn how they really fought in the middle ages? Forget any ideas about crude battering on armour; the successful warrior strikes to the gaps and the openings of his or her opponent&#39;s attacks, and supplements this with disarms, throws, and other techniques which secure the advantage over larger or stronger attackers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/c/0/event_198888832.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around the year 1400, Fiore dei Liberi trained medieval knights and squires, and authored multiple books of medieval combat, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/SSGBoston/pages/Beginning_Resources_%28Written%29/&quot;&gt;some of which have survived to the present day&lt;/a&gt;. His method, &lt;i&gt;L&#39;Arte d&#39;Armizare&lt;/i&gt; (the Art of Bearing Arms), shows an integrated and cross-referenced system of sword, dagger, grappling, spear &amp;amp; lance, pollaxe and other weapons on foot and on horseback, with and without armour, and easily dispels any illusions that medieval combat was about unskilled strength.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/8/4/event_198888772.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our beginners&#39; course is four linked classes that give the basic techniques and vocabulary of &lt;i&gt;L&#39;Arte&lt;/i&gt;, and enables men and women to begin regular unarmoured training and learning with the SSG Boston Branch.  No prior training needed; all class equipment is provided.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, come join the scholars and combatants of our company!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(The price shown includes all four classes (August 9, 16, 23 and 30) and membership and registration.  We&#39;ll send an email with some class materials before the first session.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

-71.37908AUGUST: Narcopolis by Jeet Thayil at Coriander Bistro in Sharon
http://www.meetup.com/bookclub-1439/events/168931092/
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Narcopolis by Jeet Thayil&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Narcopolis is the debut novel of Indian author Jeet Thayil, previously known for his poetry. It is a novel about opium and its effect, set in 1970s Old Bombay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shuklaji Street, in Old Bombay. In Rashid&#39;s opium room the air is thick and potent. A beautiful young woman leans to hold a long-stemmed pipe over a flame, her hair falling across her dark eyes. Around her, men sprawl and mutter in the gloom, each one drifting with his own tide. Here, people say that you introduce only your worst enemy to opium.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Outside, stray dogs lope in packs. Street vendors hustle. Hookers call for custom through the bars of their cages as their pimps slouch in doorways in the half-light. There is an underworld whisper of a new terror: the Pathar Maar, the stone killer, whose victims are the nameless, invisible poor. There are too many of them to count in this broken city.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Narcopolis is a rich, chaotic, hallucinatory dream of a novel that captures the Bombay of the 1970s in all its compelling squalor. With a cast of pimps, pushers, poets, gangsters and eunuchs, it is a journey into a sprawling underworld written in electric and utterly original prose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tara&#39;s Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• There are 23 copies in the library system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• This will our group&#39;s first time at Coriander Bistro. It receives high ratings from several sources like Zagat&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Giver.&quot;  Read the book in graduate school.  It was good.  The movie comes out August 15th.   Not sure of the times yet.  And this is a different way to enjoy lunch.  Just a suggestion...&lt;/p&gt;

http://www.meetup.com/Social-In-Boston/events/198814782/
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Social In Boston Presents:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BOSTON ROOF DECKS TOUR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Summer of 2014 is going to be a great one for the members of Social In Boston! One part of what makes it so great is our weekly roof deck tour. Each and every Saturday we&#39;ll be visiting a different roof deck for food, drinks, relaxation, and socializing. Please the details carefully every week, as the details are going to change. Some venues have better times to visit than others, and as already stated, each week will be in a different location...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our Ninth Stop...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/e/d/0/highres_394344272.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Housed in a converted greenhouse, Daedalus makes good use of its two-story digs, with a separate bar and dining area on the first floor and a dark lounge area upstairs where there is another bar, couches, and tables situated under the glass roof. These days the second floor is packed with a lively weekend crowd sampling such appetizers as crispy, tangy panseared crab cakes with chipotle aioli served over tossed greens. The menu changes seasonally, highlighting traditional dishes with interesting twists.... fair prices and charming atmosphere make Daedalus the kind of place that could become a neighborhood favorite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Join us on the roof deck to eat lunch, relax, and savor an experience like no other!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;On the menu:&lt;/b&gt; Click here for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harvardsquare.com/sites/default/files/daedalus%2Bcomplete.pdf&quot;&gt;the menu&lt;/a&gt;.

-71.062424relax our bodies and learn how to meditate
http://www.meetup.com/boston072/events/195958532/
&lt;p&gt;No matter how delicious we can try to make meditation sound in order to tempt you into meditating, this is a fruit that is meant to be eaten and not just described. In the end, it is not for anyone else but you yourself. Meditation removes the blindfold, the darkness that covers our eyes from the truth. Meditation generates the inner light that gives us vision to see just what is really happening around us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you attain true bliss and happiness inside yourself through meditation, you will feel so overwhelmed with joy that you will not be able to adequately find words to describe it. No one can do this for you, you have to attain it yourself in order to understand how it feels. When you eat a chili, for example, others may ask you how it tastes, but you can only tell them that it is spicy. They do not really know what spicy means until they try it for themselves. Thus, you cannot describe inner happiness to others. You cannot attain inner peace for others and others cannot attain it for you. This is the truth of life. You must do it for yourself. Embrace the simple relaxed dhammakaya meditation technique that can be used by people of all faiths, regardless of nationality or race to attain inner happiness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our meditation sessions are conducted by Dhammakaya practitioners who have committed their lives by ordaining to teaching meditation and dhamma (reality of life). They are eager to teach their technique and wisdom on meditation methods, benefits and knowledge gained from meditation, and our true purpose. Every session will be inspiring and will help encourage one to meditate. Though many of us are aware that meditation can help reduce stress, there is still so much more to learn from benefits of meditating. We constantly need to be reminded on how meditating can be beneficial to our overall well being, otherwise it is easy to forget.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For anyone that might be interested in furthering their understanding and learning meditation&lt;br/&gt;Contact: Rose ([masked]) [masked]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Location: 65 Roberts St. Quincy, MA 02169&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To learn more about our group please visit our website www.facebook.com/boston072&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meditationcircle.org&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please take a look at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dhammakaya.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dhammakaya.net/&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://www.dhammakaya.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Dhammakaya Meditation and our Dhammakaya Foundation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Become MFA fan www.facebook.com/boston072&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;follow us &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/boston072&quot; class=&quot;linkified&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/boston072&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
